Those years of chaplaincy afforded him much time for study, which God richly blessed. At the age of twenty-six, Owen began a forty-one year writing span that produced more than eighty works.

It was a conversation with a family friend that challenged him to think more deeply about his faith, and from that point on he became committed to evangelistic work. While recovering from his bullet wound in 1917 Grubb was handed a tract about the Heart of Africa Mission and the work of C.T. Studd in the Belgian Congo. After reading this tract he felt a calling to join Studd in his missionary activities.<p>\r\nAfter Studdâ€™s death in 1931, it was learned that he had left a letter appointing Grubb as president of the ministry he had founded, World Evangelisation Crusade (W.E.C., WEC International), in place of himself. Grubb however thought it would be better to be called secretary instead. W.E.C. grew from one mission field with 35 workers to a worldwide mission operating in over 40 fields with thousands of workers from around the world, all living according to the principle that all needs will be supplied by God with no appeals to man. The mission continues to this day under the name of Worldwide Evangelization for Christ.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

Was a British Methodist preacher who founded The Salvation Army and became its first General (1878–1912). The Christian movement with a quasi-military structure and government founded in 1865 has spread from London, England to many parts of the world and is known for being one of the largest distributors of humanitarian aid. Though Booth became a prominent Methodist evangelist, he was unhappy that the annual conference of the denomination kept assigning him to a pastorate, the duties of which he had to neglect to respond to the frequent requests that he do evangelistic campaigns. At the Liverpool conference in 1861, after having spent three years at Gateshead, his request to be freed for evangelism full-time was refused yet again, and Booth resigned from the ministry of the Methodist New Connexion.\r\n<p>\r\nThe name The Salvation Army developed from an incident in May 1878. William Booth was dictating a letter to his secretary George Scott Railton and said, \"We are a volunteer army.\" Bramwell Booth heard his father and said, \"Volunteer, I'm no volunteer, I'm a regular!\" Railton was instructed to cross out the word \"volunteer\" and substitute the word \"salvation\". The Salvation Army was modelled after the military, with its own flag (or colours) and its own music, often with Christian words to popular and folkloric tunes sung in the pubs. Booth and the other soldiers in \"God's Army\" would wear the Army's own uniform, 'putting on the armour,' for meetings and ministry work. He became the \"General\" and his other ministers were given appropriate ranks as \"officers\". Other members became \"soldiers\".<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

Rice believed that the mission of churches was \"not to take care of Christians\" but to \"win souls,\" a notion his mostly lower-middle-class church members did not wholeheartedly endorse. When Rice spent more time away from his pulpit to hold revivals elsewhere, a supply pastor and his supporters staged a coup. Rice decided to reenter evangelism. Yet before he did so, he encouraged the church to change its name from Fundamentalist Baptist Tabernacle to Galilean Baptist Church, thus distinguishing his ministry and that of the church from J. Frank Norris.<p>\r\nIn 1934, Rice founded The Sword of the Lord, a bi-weekly publication that grew into an influential fundamentalist Baptist newspaper. At first it was simply the publication of his Dallas church, handed out on the street and delivered door-to-door by Rice's daughters and other Sunday School children. The Sword's circulation grew dramatically. It was thirty thousand in 1940, fifty thousand in 1946, and ninety thousand in 1953, surpassing the circulation of the venerable Moody Monthly. Rice regularly published reports from evangelistic campaigns that became valuable publicity tools for approved revivalists. In 1946, he and other prominent evangelists adopted a code of ethics and a statement of faith to prevent \"evangelists from being unduly criticized for commercialism and unethical practices.\" The same year Bob Jones College conferred on him an honorary Litt.

Lloyd-Jones was well known for his style of expository preaching, and the Sunday morning and evening meetings at which he officiated drew crowds of several thousand, as did the Friday evening Bible studies, which were, in effect, sermons in the same style. He would take many months, even years, to expound a chapter of the Bible verse by verse. His sermons would often be around fifty minutes to an hour in length, attracting many students from universities and colleges in London. His sermons were also transcribed and printed (virtually verbatim) in the weekly Westminster Record, which was read avidly by those who enjoyed his preaching. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mljtrust.org\">MLJ Trust<\/a> now archives all his audio messages preached over the years, a staggering 1600 sermons.<p>\r\nLloyd-Jones retired from his ministry at Westminster Chapel in 1968, following a major operation. For the rest of his life, he concentrated on editing his sermons to be published, counselling other ministers, answering letters and attending conferences. Perhaps his most famous publication is a 14 volume series of commentaries on the Epistle to the Romans, the first volume of which was published in 1970.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

Maxwell was born in Salina, Kansas in 1895 to Edwin Hugh and Marion (nÃ©e Anderson) Maxwell. He was a graduate of the Midland Bible Institute, a short lived school of the Christian and Missionary Alliance in Kansas City. He was invited to come to the town of Three Hills, Alberta by J. Fergus Kirk, a Presbyterian lay preacher and farmer. Maxwell's assignment was to teach the Bible to the local young people through a structured curriculum he was to develop. On October 9, 1922 the Prairie Bible Institute was opened with eight students.<p>\r\nL. E. Maxwell readily became the school's dynamic principal and eventual president. Under his leadership Prairie Bible Institute grew to become Canada's premier missionary training center with international influence among evangelical Christians. In addition to the Bible School in Three Hills, another Bible Institute was initiated in the north at Sexsmith, Alberta and a Christian Academy was added on the Three Hills campus in the 1930s. After Maxwell's death in 1984 two more post-secondary schools were created to train missionary pilots and professional trades personnel. Today, as many as 900 students study each year at one of these five schools founded or influenced by L.E. Maxwell.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

Many other things we might give thee warning of (gentle Reader) if we had not exceeded the measure of a Preface already. It remaineth, that we commend thee to God, and to the Spirit of his grace, which is able to build further than we can ask or think. He removeth the scales from our eyes, the vail from our hearts, opening our wits that we may understand his word, enlarging our hearts, yea correcting our affections, that we may love it to the end. Ye are brought unto fountains of living water which ye digged not; do not cast earth into them with the Philistines, neither prefer broken pits before them with the wicked Jews. [Gen 26:15. Jer 2:13.] Others have laboured, and you may enter into their labours; O receive not so great things in vain, O despise not so great salvation! Be not like swine to tread under foot so precious things, neither yet like dogs to tear and abuse holy things. Say not to our Saviour with the Gergesites, Depart out of our coast [Matt 8:34]; neither yet with Esau sell your birthright for a mess of pottage [Heb 12:16]. If light be come into the world, love not darkness more than light; if food, if clothing be offered, go not naked, starve not yourselves. Remember the advice of Nazianzene, \"It is a grievous thing\" (or dangerous) \"to neglect a great fair, and to seek to make markets afterwards:\" also the encouragement of S. Chrysostom, \"It is altogether impossible, that he that is sober\" (and watchful) \"should at any time be neglected:\" [S. Chrysost. in epist. ad Rom. cap. 14. oral. 26.]<p>\r\nLastly, the admonition and menacing of S. Augustine, \"They that despise God's will inviting them, shall feel God's will taking vengeance of them.\" [S. August. ad artic. sibi falso object. Artic. 16.] It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God; [Heb 10:31] but a blessed thing it is, and will bring us to everlasting blessedness in the end, when God speaketh unto us, to hearken; when he setteth his word before us, to read it; when he stretcheth out his hand and calleth, to answer, Here am I, here we are to do thy will, O God. The Lord work a care and conscience in us to know him and serve him, that we may be acknowledged of him at the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with the holy Ghost, be all praise and thanksgiving.

Was a British evangelical Christian missionary to China whose story was told in the book The Small Woman by Alan Burgess, published in 1957. In 1958, the story was made into the Hollywood film The Inn of the Sixth Happiness, starring Ingrid Bergman.<p>\r\nAfter 20 years in China, Gladys returned to England in 1940. She was embarrassed to find that she quickly became a celebrity. A book, movie and TV documentary were all made about her life. To many Gladys became known by many as \"The Small Women,\" the title of her biography. She continued to travel and speak about her beloved China, returning to Taiwan in 1957. Humble in spirit, Gladys once made this comment to a friend, \"I wasn't God's first choice for what I've done for China. There was somebody else. I don't know who it was --- God's first choice. It must have been a man --- a wonderful man, a well-educated man. I don't know what happened. Perhaps he died. Perhaps he wasn't willing.

When the Communists took over in China, Dr. and Mrs. Culpepper and their children were transferred to Hong Kong where Dr. Culpepper served as treasurer of the Hong Kong Baptist Mission.<p>\r\nWhen Miss Monsen greeted them at the door, her first words to the Culpeppers was a question, “Brother Culpepper, have you been filled with the Holy Spirit?” The issue of the filling of the Holy Spirit, also referred to by the missionaries as the “baptism in the Holy Spirit,” served as a major theme of the ensuing revival, as the missionaries reported it. Miss Monsen related to the Culpeppers scriptures related to healing, particularly James 5:14-16. Mr. Culpepper said that “the words ‘confess your faults’ particularly pierced [his] heart”. Confession of sin and an emphasis on consecrated holiness is another phenomenon that characterized the revival.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

SAINT, SOLDIER, PREACHER, SCHOLAR, Lecturer, AUTHOR, Translator, Craftsman, AND INTERCESSOR There was something special about David Davies. His love for Jesus invaded all of his life. He was not the flamboyant type who threw his Christianity at you but there was an aura of saintliness about him. He just loved to talk about his Lord.  God gave him real fluency in languages (he spoke at least 7 fluently!) and he soon started preaching and teaching and seeing people coming to faith in Jesus and grow in grace. He became a powerful preacher almost to the end of his life with a lovely ability to expound Godâ€™s word in ways that blessed many.<p>\r\n But as well as having tradesmanâ€™s skills he showed aptitude for writing and became the author of various books in Congo languages including a version of Pilgrimâ€™s Progress which influenced the lives of many Christians. Because of his language skills he translated (even at the age of 88) various booklets and made them available to Congolese believers. The events surrounding Congoâ€™s independence and their involvement pushed him into writing for a wider audience the stories of the suffering believers and fellow missionary Winnie Davies. The Congo Revival in 1953-54 touched his life deeply. The story of his experience was shared with audiences in many places and left a trail of blessing.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

In 1926 Wilkes and his wife were back in England and then visited his sister Mary Dunn Pattison then leading a Christian group at Chalet Point du Jour near Geneva. After visiting South Africa in the spring of 1927 for 6 months, Wilkes revisited Switzerland in Autumn 1927. He was particularly active, travelling over 4000 miles and holding 220 meetings, and as a result his health was impaired. He left England in February 1928 but was taken ill on arrival in Canada. So he returned to England and then Switzerland where he stayed at the Spiritual centre at Vennes.

This biography is written by his son, who states in his preface that he has deliberately tried not to present his father's life through rose colored glasses but rather give a true and accurate account--warts and all.

Niranam has immense historical significance in the tradition of Saint Thomas, a disciple of Jesus Christ who planted the first church there in AD 52.  K.P. Yohannan dedicated his life to God at a young age to serve the needy and downtrodden. He prayed, â€œOh my Lord, let my heart break with the things that break Your heartâ€ and his life was never the same. Itâ€™s his belief that one can only demonstrate Godâ€™s love by loving people. After over four decades of selfless service, he says, I have no regrets in praying that prayer for I know God has touched millions through what He did in and through me. It is all Godâ€™s grace.\r\n<p>\r\nHe spent the early years of his service in North India and traveled to the remote villages sharing the love of Christ and doing charitable works. Through numerous encounters during those years, he was instilled with an increasing passion to bring hope, peace, and comfort to the needy and deprived. His sacrificial commitment, farsightedness and aptitude to perceive helped him to lead a life of unhindered devotion to serve Christ and His church. K.P. Yohannan is also the voice of Athmeeya Yathra, touching millions through his daily radio and TV broadcasts.

In contrast to Whitefield's Calvinism, Wesley embraced the Arminian doctrines that were dominant in the 18th-century Church of England. Methodism in both forms became a highly successful evangelical movement in Britain, which encouraged people to experience Jesus Christ personally.\r\n<p>\r\nWesley helped to organise and form societies of Christians throughout Great Britain, North America and Ireland as small groups that developed intensive, personal accountability, discipleship and religious instruction among members. His great contribution was to appoint itinerant, unordained preachers who travelled widely to evangelise and care for people in the societies. Under Wesley's direction, Methodists became leaders in many social issues of the day, including the prison reform and abolitionism movements.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

As a young man he became aware that the Lord was calling him into the work of the ministry. At timely stages the Lord placed folk in his path who were able to direct him into the truth of heart purity and a more expansive understanding of the ministry of the Holy Spirit. He held pastorates in Kent and Bradford. By the late 1960s, following a significant period of ministry in Liverpool, he began a more itinerant ministry. This led him to many parts of the world, and occupied him until well into his eighties. His powerful preaching and the unique sense of the Lord's presence, which seemed to brood over his meetings, were always intensely challenging.<p>\r\nThe true secret of his remarkable ministry stemmed from his personal communion with the Lord Jesus. To him, 'entering the holiest' was not merely a theological concept; it was a distinct spiritual reality - and the central feature of his spiritual life. It was here, in the place of worship, that his revelatory ministry found its source. He preached from understanding and conviction. He was never the echo of another, nor did he take on board the ebb and flow of various contemporary emphases. He was not a man of 'books'; he soaked himself in Scripture and allowed it to saturate his heart and mind. Truly, this is a man who has lifted up a standard for the people. Mr North went to be with the Lord on 29th April 2003, shortly after his ninetieth birthday.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

Edwards \"is widely acknowledged to be America's most important and original philosophical theologian,\" and one of America's greatest intellectuals. Edwards's theological work is broad in scope, but he was rooted in Reformed theology, the metaphysics of theological determinism, and the Puritan heritage. Recent studies have emphasized how thoroughly Edwards grounded his life's work on conceptions of beauty, harmony, and ethical fittingness, and how central The Enlightenment was to his mindset. Edwards played a critical role in shaping the First Great Awakening, and oversaw some of the first revivals in 1733–35 at his church in Northampton, Massachusetts.\r\n<p>\r\nEdwards delivered the sermon \"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God\", a classic of early American literature, during another revival in 1741, following George Whitefield's tour of the Thirteen Colonies. Edwards is well known for his many books, The End For Which God Created the World, The Life of David Brainerd, which served to inspire thousands of missionaries throughout the 19th century, and Religious Affections, which many Reformed Evangelicals still read today.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

He entered the school of African and Oriental studies at London University to prepare for the Lord's work in China. He studied Classical Chinese, Mandarin, Oriental Philosophy and Far Eastern History, but the revolution closed the door to his entry into China. Lance was noted for his eschatological views, which placed him in the tradition of Watchman Nee and T. Austin-Sparks.

Though raised in a religious home, Skip saw religion as a dead-end street with no answers. As a teenager, he got caught up in drugs and ventured into the occult. But God reached Skip one day in 1973 as he was watching a Billy Graham crusade on TV. The gospel message penetrated his soul, and he knelt and prayed to receive Christ.<p>\r\nSkip studied under Chuck Smith at Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa, California, until 1981. After he married Lenya, the couple moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he worked in the medical field of radiology. In 1982, Skip began a home Bible study, which eventually grew into Calvary Albuquerque. In 1988 and 1989, Calvary Albuquerque was considered the fastest growing church in America. Today, Calvary Albuquerque ministers to over 15,000 people every weekend. Calvary Albuquerque has been instrumental in planting other churches, including several in Arizona, Colorado, and other parts of New Mexico.

In this insightful and thought provoking book, Robert Wurtz II traces the history of Christian evangelism from the book of Acts to modern times. The contrast between pre-1900 and post-1900 evangelism is so sharp, that the book is divided into two sections: Part 1, the pre-Billy Sunday era and Part 2, the post-Billy Sunday evangelistic era. This book is a must-read for anyone that has concerns about issues such as \"the sinner's prayer\" or shallow concepts of conversion.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

Was a preacher born in Bangor, County Down, Ireland. Nicknamed \"the Tornado of the Pulpit\", Nicholson spent his early years on his father's cargo ship. He began to preach Christianity in 1899 at the age of 23 and was known for his \"men-only\" meetings. Nicholson used straightforward language which communicated to the common man.<p>\r\n\"Nicholson used to say that when a mission was begun it was not long before they had either a riot or revival. Sometimes we had more riot than revival, but never a revival without a riot.\" Nicholson wielded the Sword of the Spirit with a fury. His hearers were always affected one way or another. Some through his preaching were brought to humble repentance, while others resisted God's Word with indignation. Two favorite themes of Nicholson were \"God's love\" and \"God's hell.\" W. P. Nicholson always preached the love of God with all the warmth and tenderness he could muster; but for those who rejected this Good News, he offered the only alternative, GOD'S HELL. He preached on every aspect of hell with such zeal and passion that his hearers claimed to be able to almost smell the burning sulphur. Still others, under deep conviction and anxiety, dripped with sweat and unconsciously shredded the hymn books they held in their laps. Through this kind of fervent preaching, God brought entire communities face to face with the question, \"What shall I do with Jesus?\" One elderly man who had recollections of the Ulster Revival of 1859 said that some of the effects of Nicholson's meetings even exceeded what happened in '59. Another commentator on Nicholson's work said that he had seen nothing like it since the days of D. L. Moody.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n"

William Fitch was the minister of Springburn Hill Parish Church in Glasgow from 1938 until 1955. He then served as the minister of Knox Presbyterian Church in Toronto from 1955-1972. Here is an except about his ministry and arrival to Toronto from Glasgow: After another long vacancy William Fitch arrived from Scotland in 1955, fresh from the leadership of the committee of the Billy Graham crusade in Glasgowâ€™s Kelvin Hall. In many ways he was a new Robert Burns, so like his fellow Scot from the Glasgow area who had arrived 110 years before. He was a great preacher, whose expositions gave positive evidence of his doctorate in biblical studies. In his evangelistic zeal he sought to reach the students of the University for Christ. He sought to follow the model of British ministers such as John Stott in London, who made a church alongside a university into a student centre, without in any way neglecting the rest of the congregation. He also continued the stress on missions and most of the Knox missionaries whose pictures are on the north wall of the Winchester Room went out under his ministry. In the later years of his ministry Fitch was far from well, and retired in early 1972.<p>\r\nIn an interesting moment of reflection, William Still recounted the mindset he had as he went from University to be a one year intern in a small parish church under Fitch at Springburn Hill. Still wrote: I left Aberdeen to take up an assistantship at Springburnhill Parish Church in Glasgow under the Rev. William Fitch. Climbing tenement stairs in Springburn was different from the glamour of University life and from popularity with masses of Aberdeenâ€™s Kirk and musical folk, and since my faith was not yet very biblically founded, although real enough, I became a little cynical about my calling and doubtless grieved William Fitch by some of the things I said from his pulpit.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

McPherson has been noted as a pioneer in the use of modern media, especially radio, and was the second woman to be granted a broadcast license. She used radio to draw on the growing appeal of popular entertainment in North America and incorporated other forms into her weekly sermons at Angelus Temple.<p>\r\nIn her time she was the most publicized Christian evangelist, surpassing Billy Sunday and her other predecessors. She conducted public faith-healing demonstrations before large crowds, allegedly healing tens of thousands of people. McPherson's articulation of the United States as a nation founded and sustained by divine inspiration continues to be echoed by many pastors in churches today. Her media image, which sensationalized difficulties with her mother and daughter, as well as a mysterious five-week disappearance, shrouded her extensive charity work and significant contributions to the revitalization of American Christianity in the 20th century.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

Used greatly in the book: \"Revivals of Religion\" which is a classic on the subject of revival.\r\n<p>\r\nHe preached on the true Baptism of the Holy Spirit and its necessity.

He was one of the founders of Methodism and of the evangelical movement generally. He became perhaps the best-known preacher in Britain and America in the 18th century, and because he traveled through all of the American colonies and drew great crowds and media coverage, he was one of the most widely recognized public figures in colonial America.\r\n<p>\r\nWhitefield was an astounding preacher from the beginning. Though he was slender in build, he stormed in the pulpit as if he were a giant. Within a year it was said that \"his voice startled England like a trumpet blast.\" At a time when London had a population of less than 700,000, he could hold spellbound 20,000 people at a time at Moorfields and Kennington Common. For thirty-four years his preaching resounded throughout England and America. In his preaching ministry he crossed the Atlantic thirteen times and became known as the 'apostle of the British empire.' He was a firm Calvinist in his theology yet unrivaled as an aggressive evangelist. Though a clergyman of the Church of England, he cooperated with and had a profound impact on people and churches of many traditions, including Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and Baptists. Whitefield, along with the Wesleys, inspired the movement that became known as the Methodists. Whitefield preached more than 18,000 sermons in his lifetime, an average of 500 a year or ten a week. Many of them were given over and over again. Fewer than 90 have survived in any form.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

A militant fundamentalist, Jones conducted a wide-ranging campaign denouncing modernist teachings on the Bible and evolution and the abandonment of traditional Protestant social mores. Viewing the control of education as the key to defending the faith, Jones started Bob Jones College near Panama City, Florida in 1927. <p>\r\nThe financial burden of the Depression caused Jones to move the school to Cleveland, Tennessee in 1933, and financial considerations likewise played a major role in the schoolâ€™s final move to Greenville, South Carolina in 1947 (where it became Bob Jones University). Jones was an early supporter of the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE) but by the mid-1950s had broken with the movement, largely over its support of Billy Graham (who had left the school after his freshman year), whom Jones and his militant son Bob Jones, Jr. viewed as a compromiser for his inclusion of mainline clergy in his evangelistic crusades. Increasingly, Bob Jones, Sr. and Jr. and their University were seen as the embodiment of ultra-separatist fundamentalism. Although the school emphasized a film school and prided itself on its Shakespearian productions and art collection, the Jonesâ€™ insistence on rigid social policies and the maintenance of on-campus segregation (black students were not admitted until 1971 and a ban against interracial dating was in place until 2000) made it a symbol in the popular press and among many evangelicals of the backward-looking mindset of the fundamentalist movement.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

I came to Christ at a Billy Graham Los Angeles Crusade in the 1960's. While completing my Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration at Cal Poly Pomona, I sensed the call of God on my life to follow Jesus Christ completely and possibly forget business and prepare for the ministry.. Soon after that I met Alan Redpath who invited me and my wife Jean to England, where we attended Capernwray Bible School. Upon returning to the United States, I continued my studies at Talbot Seminary in La Mirada, California.<p>\r\nEarly in my ministry, I served for four years as an assistant pastor to Chuck Smith at Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa, California. Next Jean and I moved to Lake Arrowhead where we planted and pastored Calvary Chapel of Lake Arrowhead. During those years I founded Calvary Chapel Bible College in nearby Twin Peaks at the Calvary Chapel Conference Center (The college is now located in Murrieta Hot Springs). Sensing the Lord's direction to move on, we then pioneered and pastored another Calvary Chapel in Redlands, California, for eleven years. In 1991, we again, still having that pioneering heart, moved to San Jose with the heart to plant a number of churches in the Bay Area. There are now eight fellowships that have grown out of Calvary Chapel of San Jose. In September 2002, we responded to a request from Chuck Smith to return to Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa to serve as an assistant. And, in 2004 we took to the leadership of Calvary Chapel of Laguna Beach to help guide it through a difficult time. That work being completed, we have now responded to a long time desire to step out and serve the churches and schools and missionaries that we love so much around the world.

Manley chose daily healing because for him it was an act of faith that each day the Lord had to heal him to the point that he could get out of bed. During those years there were more confinements in the hospital, as well as trips to Europe and revivals all over the United States.

Was a canon regular of the late medieval period and the most probable author of The Imitation of Christ, which is one of the best known Christian books on devotion. His name means \"Thomas of Kempen\", his hometown, and in German he is known as Thomas von Kempen. He also is known by various spellings of his family name: Thomas Haemerken; Thomas Hammerlein; Thomas Hemerken and Thomas HÃ¤merken.<p>\r\nHis first tenure of office as subprior was interrupted by the exile of the community from Agnetenberg (1429). A dispute had arisen in connection with an appointment to the vacant See of Utrecht. Pope Martin V rejected the nomination of Bishop-elect Rudolf van Diepholt, and imposed an interdict. The Canons remained in exile in observance of the interdict until the question was settled (1432). During this time, Thomas was sent to Arnhem to care for his ailing brother. He remained there until his brother died November, 1432. Thomas spent his time between devotional exercises, composition, and copying. He copied the Bible no fewer than four times,[3] one of the copies being preserved at Darmstadt, Germany in five volumes. In its teachings he was widely read and his works abound in Biblical quotations, especially from the New Testament.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

Lewis and known to his friends and family as \"Jack\", was a novelist, poet, academic, medievalist, literary critic, essayist, lay theologian, and Christian apologist born in Belfast, Ireland. He held academic positions at both Oxford University (Magdalen College), 1925â€“1954, and Cambridge University (Magdalene College), 1954â€“1963. He is best known both for his fictional work, especially The Screwtape Letters, The Chronicles of Narnia, and The Space Trilogy, and for his non-fiction Christian apologetics, such as Mere Christianity, Miracles, and The Problem of Pain.<p>\r\nLewis and fellow novelist J. R. R. Tolkien were close friends. Both authors served on the English faculty at Oxford University, and both were active in the informal Oxford literary group known as the \"Inklings\". According to his memoir Surprised by Joy, Lewis had been baptized in the Church of Ireland (part of the Anglican Communion) at birth, but fell away from his faith during his adolescence. Owing to the influence of Tolkien and other friends, at the age of 32 Lewis returned to the Anglican Communion, becoming \"a very ordinary layman of the Church of England\". His faith had a profound effect on his work, and his wartime radio broadcasts on the subject of Christianity brought him wide acclaim.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

Was a Scottish evangelist, writer and lecturer. Drummond was born in Stirling. He was educated at Edinburgh University, where he displayed a strong inclination for physical and mathematical science. The religious element was an even more powerful factor in his nature, and disposed him to enter the Free Church of Scotland. While preparing for the ministry, he became for a time deeply interested in the evangelizing mission of Moody and Sankey, in which he actively co-operated for two years.<p>\r\nIn 1877 he became lecturer on natural science in the Free Church College, which enabled him to combine all the pursuits for which he felt a vocation. His studies resulted in his writing Natural Law in the Spiritual World, the argument of which is that the scientific principle of continuity extends from the physical world to the spiritual. Before the book was published in 1883, an invitation from the African Lakes Company drew Drummond away to Central Africa.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

Was an American Baptist preacher, writer, composer, and founder of Gordon College and Gordonâ€“Conwell Theological Seminary. In 1889, with the help and backing of Clarendon Street Church, he founded Gordon Bible Institute and served as its first president. His wife, Maria, was secretary and treasurer until 1908. Gordon's school was founded primarily to train missionaries for work in the Congo. Gordon edited two hymn books and wrote the hymn tunes for at least fifteen hymns, including \"My Jesus, I Love Thee,\" a hymn that has been included in nearly every evangelical hymnal published from 1876 to the present time. In his book The Ministry of the Holy Spirit, Gordon wrote, \"It seems clear from the Scriptures that it is still the duty and privilege of believers to receive the Holy Spirit by a conscious, definite act of appropriating faith, just as they received Jesus Christ\" (see Baptism with the Holy Spirit).<p>\r\nHis most remembered work is probably The Ministry of Healing, a highly revered book on divine healingâ€”physical, mental, and spiritual. Gordon located healing in Christ's Atonement, meaning it was universally available through faith in Christ. He prayed for the sick privately, however, and did not integrate healing into his regular church ministry. The Ministry of Healing became a standard work among early Pentecostals.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

Was born in Brussels, Belgium to a pair of missionaries, Philip and Katherine Howard. However, Elisabethâ€™s time abroad didnâ€™t last long; her family moved back to the Philadelphia area when she was five months old because her father had accepted a job as the editor of a small newspaper. As Elisabeth grew up, missionaries were regularly visiting the Howard household, having a profound impact on Elisabeth's choice to attend Wheaton College, in order to study classical Greek so that she could work in the missions field as a Bible translator. It was there that Elisabeth met Jim Elliot, who would become her first husband after the two had served independently as mission workers in Ecuador. Tragically, Jim was brutally murdered by the Aucan Indiansâ€”the very tribe Jim was trying to save. Instead of returning to the States, Elisabeth continued to commit her life to Christ and lived with the very tribe that had speared her husband to death.<p>\r\nElisabeth and her daughter, Valerie, moved back to Massachusetts in 1963. She later married a professor named Addison Leitch, who died of cancer in 1973. In 1974, Elisabeth accepted a position as an Adjunct Professor at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary. She taught off-and-on for a few years, until she took the Writer in Residence at Gordon College. In 1977, she married again. This time to a man by the name of Lars Gren. Elisabeth is the author of nearly twenty books, including Shadow of the Almighty and Passion and Purity, which both tell the story of Jim and Elisabethâ€™s lives. Elisabeth toured the nation for the majority of her life, telling all that she had learned in her widely experienced life. She also hosted a daily radio show, Gateway to Joy for thirteen years, until 2001. Now, she and her husband, Lars, live in Beverly, Massachusetts.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

Saint Athanasius of Alexandria (\/ËŒÃ¦Î¸É™ËˆneÉªÊƒÉ™s\/; Greek: á¼ˆÎ¸Î±Î½Î¬ÏƒÎ¹Î¿Ï‚ á¼ˆÎ»ÎµÎ¾Î±Î½Î´ÏÎµÎ¯Î±Ï‚, AthanÃ¡sios AlexandrÃ­as; c. 296â€“298 â€“ 2 May 373), also called Athanasius the Great, Athanasius the Confessor or, primarily in the Coptic Orthodox Church, Athanasius the Apostolic, was the twentieth bishop of Alexandria (as Athanasius I). His episcopate lasted 45 years (c. 8 June 328 â€“ 2 May 373), of which over 17 were spent in five exiles ordered by four different Roman emperors. Athanasius was a Christian theologian, a Church Father, the chief defender of Trinitarianism against Arianism, and a noted Egyptian leader of the fourth century..<p>\r\nWithin a few years after his death, Gregory of Nazianzus called him the \"Pillar of the Church\". His writings were well regarded by all Church fathers who followed, in both the West and the East, who noted their rich devotion to the Word-become-man, great pastoral concern, and profound interest in monasticism. Athanasius is counted as one of the four great Eastern Doctors of the Church in the Roman Catholic Church.[3] In the Eastern Orthodox Church, he is labeled as the \"Father of Orthodoxy\". Some Protestants label him as \"Father of the Canon\". Athanasius is venerated as a Christian saint, whose feast day is 2 May in Western Christianity, 15 May in the Coptic Orthodox Church, and 18 January in the other Eastern Orthodox Churches. He is venerated by the Oriental and Eastern Orthodox Churches, the Roman Catholic Church, the Lutherans, and the Anglican Communion.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

Was a Scottish church leader, theologian and philosopher. He was born at Duns. His father, John Boston, and his mother, Alison Trotter, were both Covenanters. He was educated at Edinburgh, and licensed in 1697 by the presbytery of Chirnside. In 1699 he became minister of the small parish of Simprin, where there were only 90 examinable persons; previously, he was a schoolmaster in Glencairn. In 1704 he found, while visiting a member of his flock, a book brought into Scotland by a commonwealth soldier, the Marrow of Modern Divinity, by Edward Fisher, a compendium of the opinions of leading Reformation divines on the doctrine of grace and the offer of the Gospel, which set off the Marrow Controversy.<p>\r\nBoston's autobiography is a record of Scottish life. His other books include The Fourfold State, one of the religious classics of Scotland; The Crook in the Lot, a short book noted for its originality; and his Body of Divinity and Miscellanies. These works had a major influence over the Scottish peasantry. Among his works is a learned treatise on Hebrew points. His Memoirs were published in 1776 (ed. George D. Low, 1908). An edition of his works in 12 volumes appeared in 1849.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

Oswald Sanders in mp3 format. Russell Lee Kelfer was born in San Antonio, Texas, November 14, 1933 and was welcomed into the presence of his Lord February 3, 2000. While in high school he met Martha Lee Williams, and as journalism majors working on the school newspaper, they became high school sweethearts with a mutual love of the written word. At the age of 19, Russell fell in love with The Word, and he was born from above into the Kingdom of God. He and Martha were married June 23, 1953 and have two children, Kay and Steven. The lights of Russell's life were his four Cottingham grandchildren, Lauren, Miles, Emily, and James Russell. When an eye injury while he was a student at the University of Texas precluded the reading required to finish his journalism degree, Russell gave up his dreams of becoming a writer to go into the family business, Kelfer Tire Company.<p>\r\nOver the years the tire salesman was used of God in ways which illustrate the Scriptural principle which is the theme of his homegoing celebration: \"For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many noble, are called: But God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty\" (I Corinthians 1:23). God called Russell to a variety of Kingdom tasks for which he had no worldly credentials, proving to all of us that \"My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness\". Russell never once sought the projects described. God gently led him into them, usually by way of such small beginnings that as he would say, \"I didn't have sense enough to be frightened\". He was always most comfortable in his one-to-one relationships. Speaking to groups never ever became easy. The butterflies were always there, but he felt they were God's tool for keeping him dependent. Around the world his spiritual children join us in thanking the Father for allowing us to see Him in Russell.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

Four days later, despite government threats, 45,000 Ugandans gathered in the Anglican cathedral in Kampala for a memorial service honoring their fallen leader. Kivengere did not attend the service. Urged to flee by friends who said, \"One dead bishop is enough,\" he and his wife that night drove as far as their vehicle could take them and with the help of local church people in the hills they walked until the next morning brought them to safety across the border in Rwanda.[1]<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n"

Bob's involvement with the Calvary Chapels began in 1971, when he and his wife Dini visited Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa on a Sunday evening. They were deeply touched by the life-giving teaching of the word of God, the simple worship \"in Spirit and in truth\", and the profound expressions of the love of the Lord among the saints. Upon returning to Dallas, they regularly obtained Pastor Chuck Smith's teaching tapes and eventually became daily listeners of the Word for Today on the radio.\r\n<p>\r\nSince 1993, Bob had been teaching at Calvary Chapel and other church fellowships across the country and overseas (including, Seminars, Pastors' Conferences, Church Services, Leadership Conferences, Retreats, and Schools of Evangelism\/Ministry).

Is a prominent Bible teacher based in Great Britain. He is the author of more than thirty books. Pawson left Millmead in 1979 and engaged in an itinerant worldwide Bible teaching ministry predominantly through seminars for church leaders in Asia, Australia, Africa, England, Europe, and United States. Millions of copies of his teachings have been distributed in more than 120 countries, providing a solid biblical foundation. He is a writer and speaker of urgency, clarity, and uncompromising faithfulness to the Scriptures. His extensive and very accessible overviews of the books of the Bible have been published and recorded in â€˜Unlocking the Bibleâ€™, available in CDs, DVDs, and YouTube. He is widely considered to be one of the world's finest biblical expositors. As of 2013, Pawson, aged 83, is still preaching at events across the globe.<p>\r\nIn Unlocking the Bible, Pawson presents a book by book study of the whole Bible. The book is based on Pawson's belief that the Bible should be studied, as it was written, \"a book at a time\" (certainly not a verse, or even a chapter at a time); and that each book is best understood by discovering why and for whom it was written. It is based on an arranged series of talks in which he set out the background, purpose, meaning and relevance of each book of the Bible, and was transcribed into written form by Andy Peck. The groundwork for this study was laid in the 1960s and '70s, when Pawson took his congregation through nearly half of the Old Testament and all of the New Testament line by line.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n"

Fuller saw vast possibilities in the new invention called â€œradio.\" He soon resigned from his pastoral responsibilities to give his full time to radio evangelism. By 1935, the voice of Dr. Fuller had become a familiar sound in the Western states. On October 3, 1937 the Old Fashioned Revival Hour aired its first broadcast over the 13 stations of the Mutual Network. Charles E. Fuller soon established the Gospel Broadcasting Association to sponsor his Old Fashioned Revival Hour (OFRH) program. In 1941 Fullerâ€™s nationwide broadcast was moved from a Hollywood studio to the Long Beach Municipal Auditorium where thousands of servicemen, enroute to the Pacific during World War II, attended the broadcast. Dr. Fuller and his OFRH musicians traveled throughout North America, holding citywide rallies which were often broadcast live.<p>\r\nBy 1951 the OFRH was heard over the ABC radio network that circled the globe through 650 radio stations. By 1955 one-million broadcast transcriptions had been made. Dr. Charles E. Fuller and his associates of the Old Fashioned Revival Hour appeared in the Long Beach Municipal Auditorium for the last time on January 12, 1958. Dr. Fuller then moved the program to a Hollywood recording studio for a 30-minute broadcast. Dr. Fullerâ€™s last broadcast was December of 1968, and he went home to be with the Lord that same year. While the Old Fashioned Revival Hour Broadcasts have ended, their tremendous appeal continues to this day.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

Since moving to Utah in January 2008 and joining Brad at Oasis Books, the ministry has been engaged in rigorous evangelism in the community. Open air preaching, distributing thousands of books, sharing the gospel one-on-one to thousands of students on Utah universities and neighboring campuses, handing out tracts, conducting outreaches at local fairs and festivals, teaching and equipping Christians on how to share their faith, and church planting, are just some of the things that are going on by the grace of God. God opened the door for us to film a full season (16 episodes) of a Christian Bible study show for a local television station. Hundreds of people who have come to the bookstore have been counseled. Oasis has organized weekly door-to-door evangelism events which reaches different kinds of people from non-Mormons, to bishops and leaders in the Mormon church. We print, publish and give away many tracts, booklets and pamphlets. Bible studies for both youth and adults are held throughout the week. We promote solid Christian books and encourage people to read. Oasis Books provides a safe place for anyone to come and talk, laugh, cry, fellowship, vent, ask questions, receive prayer, and connect with the Christian community in the valley. Most recently we have begun a Sunday morning fellowship where we focus on loving one another in meaningful relationships, expositional preaching, and promoting unity among all the saints in the valley <p>\r\nAt the time of this writing (2010) I am now 24 years old. God alone deserved all the glory for His merciful workmanship in my life; for keeping me back from atheism, and for saving me from the penalty of my sins. He gave me the free gift of eternal life through His Son's death and resurrection, and He will give them same to you. The apostle Paul wrote that \"God demonstrates His own love for us in this: that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.\" (Rom. 5:8) Simply believe the good news of who God is. Trust in His love today, no matter how sinful you are. I am thankful to all the people God has used in my life to shape and mold me thus far, and I am thankful to God for His steadfast and constant faithfulness toward me and teaching me more and more the glorious truths of His love and grace. \"He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.\" (Phil. 1:6) The most exciting thing in the whole world is to know the only true God and Jesus Christ whom He has sent! Truly Jesus said, \"The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.\" (John 10:10) Thank you, Lord!<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

From eleven years of age onward, â€œthe whole course of his youth was an even-spun thread of godly conversation,â€ wrote one observer. The times, however, are perilous. Charles I was beheaded and his son, Charles II, at the head of a Scottish army, is defeated by Cromwellâ€™s Parliamentarians at Worcester as young Joseph Alleine sets off for Corpus Christi College. At Oxford, Alleine would sit at the feet of such divines as John Owen and Thomas Goodwin.<p>\r\nAlleineâ€™s Alarm to the Unconverted, the best known of his nineteen treatises, was first printed in 1671 (subtitle: A Serious Treatise on Conversion) and subsequently printed as A Sure Guide to Heaven in 1675â€”the title given to the latest Banner of Truth Trust editions. It is a powerful manual on conversion and the call of the gospel, as the chapter titles reveal: Mistakes about Conversion; The Nature of Conversion; The Necessity of Conversion; The Marks of the Unconverted; The Miseries of the Unconverted; Directions to the Unconverted; The Motives to Conversion.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

Was an English Puritan church leader, poet, hymn-writer,[1] theologian, and controversialist. Dean Stanley called him \"the chief of English Protestant Schoolmen\". After some false starts, he made his reputation by his ministry at Kidderminster, and at around the same time began a long and prolific career as theological writer. After the Restoration he refused preferment, while retaining a non-separatist Presbyterian approach, and became one of the most influential leaders of the nonconformists, spending time in prison.<p>\r\n  He wrote 168 or so separate works -- such treatises as the Christian Directory, the Methodus Theologiae Christianae, and the Catholic Theology, might each have represented the life's work of an ordinary man. His Breviate of the Life of Mrs Margaret Baxter records the virtues of his wife, and reveals Baxter's tenderness of nature. Without doubt, however, his most famous and enduring contribution to Christian literature was a devotional work published in 1658 under the title Call to the Unconverted to Turn and Live. This slim volume was credited with the conversion of thousands and formed one of the core extra-biblical texts of evangelicalism until at least the middle of the nineteenth century. <br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n"

She also spoke to people in their homes, especially to alcoholics, whom she helped to make a new start in life. Often she held cottage meetings for converts.

A woman preacher was a rare phenomenon in a world where women had few civil rights, and no place in the professions.

He was inducted into the AcadÃ©mie FranÃ§aise in 1693 and named Archbishop of Cambrai in 1695. During his time as the educator and teacher of the Duke, FÃ©nelon wrote several entertaining and educational works, including the extensive novel Les Aventures de TÃ©lÃ©maque, fils d'Ulysse (The Adventures of Telemachus, son of Ulysses), which depicted the ideal of a wise king. When this novel began circulating anonymously among the court, having been fragmentarily published in 1699 without his knowledge, Louis XIV, who saw many criticisms of his absolutistic style of rule in TÃ©lÃ©maque, stopped the printing and banned FÃ©nelon from court. FÃ©nelon then retreated to his bishopric in Cambrai, where he remained active writing theological and political treatises until his death on January 17, 1715.<p>\r\nIn Church history, FÃ©nelon is known especially for his part in the Quietism debate with his earlier patron Bossuet. In his work Explication des maximes des Saints sur la vie intÃ©rieure (Explanation of the Adages of the Saints on the Inner Life) in 1697, he defended Madame du Guyon, the main representative of Quietistic mysticism. He provided proof that her \"heretical\" teachings could also be seen in recognized saints. In 1697, FÃ©nelon called on the pope for a decision in the Quietism debate. After long advisement, the Pope banned the Explication in 1699. FÃ©nelon complied with the pope's decision immediately and allowed the remaining copies of his book to be destroyed.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

As a fifteen-year-old from Nantyffylon, Maesteg, Wales, George became a Christian during the 1904-1905 Welsh Revival, along with his older brother Stephen. At the time, many local Christians believed the two brothers were appointed by God to do great works for Him.<p>\r\nIn the many churches, conventions and camp meetings where George and Stephen Jeffreys preached in the years after this, there were reports of many miraculous healings and other acts of God. Such healings brought George to his \"foursquare\" belief that Jesus is Saviour, Healer, Baptiser and Coming King. George, along with a small group of peers, became known as the Elim Evangelistic Band in Belfast and all over Ulster. This group of people brought crowds into their large tent, and later, into the Belfast hall they acquired. Out of this, George founded his first church in Belfast in 1914, and the Elim Foursquare Gospel Alliance, as it is officially known, was born.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

One piece is a collection of family prayers to be used morning and evening, each day of the week in family worship. Over the next few weeks, I plan to share with you those prayers for your personal and family use-my own prayer is that they will be a help and an encouragement to you in your own walk with our Lord.<p>\r\nHere is a quote from Law's work on Genesis: \"For three days Abraham journeyed towards the appointed mount. This was large opportunity for unbelief to whisper many a dissuading thought. This was long time for the fatherâ€™s heart to ache. He looks on his child, and there is agony. He looks up to his God, and the agony melts into the calmness of unruffled peace. He turns to his child, and his foot would sincerely falter. He turns to his God, and the step is firm in resolute resolve.. Behold Godâ€™s wondrous way. His word is honored. Faith triumphs, and is honored too. It is tried, and by the trial is confirmed and expanded. The patriarch now begins a new life of heavenly joy. For the joy of Isaac born is nothing to the joy of Isaac restored. A giving God was love in the highest. A restoring God is love in higher heights.\"<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

Allen became one of the first to develop a national television ministry. His television programs frequently included excerpts from his \"healing line\" ministry. By the late 1960s, however, music formed an increasingly dominant part of his programs, with that music generally being performed by African-American singer and choir leader Gene Martin.<p>\r\nA. A.

Like Spurgeon, he works himself to exhaustion.<p>\r\nIn his own words, \"We used to go out on Saturdays to evangelize door-to-door, and then invite people to church on Sunday. When I graduated in 1984 and went to work in the copper mining town of Mufulira, the church I joined immediately made me leader of the youth work. By the end of my first year in that church, the leaders had decided that I would preach every Sunday, as long as I was not working! Other churches began to call on me to preach for them too, so that by 1987 (the year I left to go into full time ministry), there was hardly a Sunday when I was not preaching somewhere. So, when the call came to pastor Kabwata Baptist Church, I was more than ready to throw aside my hard-hat and hold the plough with both hands.\"<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

Missionary and prayer center founder, Olive Bertha Smith (affectionately known as \"Miss Bertha\"), was born on November 16, 1888, near Cowpens, SC, to John McClellan Smith and Frances Thorne Smith. She attended Linwood College in North Carolina for one year, then transferred to Winthrop College, where she graduated in 1913 with a bachelor of arts degree. She worked as a teacher for one year after graduation in an elementary school in Blacksburg, South Carolina, but feeling the call to the mission field, enrolled in the Woman's Missionary Union Training School in Louisville, Kentucky and graduated in 1916. She served for one year as principal (and also as a teacher) in Spartanburg County, South Carolina at the Cooley Springs School. On July 3, 1917, the Foreign Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention appointed Smith as a missionary to China. She spent much of her initial time in China learning the Chinese alphabet and language and teaching English classes to Chinese students. She also witnessed the roots of the Shantung Revival (a period of Christian spiritual awakening for Chinese people) during her lengthy career of mission service. For some of her time in China, she was in charge of a girl's boarding school at the mission, where she taught Bible classes in both Chinese and English.<p>\r\nAfter being interned by the Japanese in 1941, Miss Bertha continued her work in China until 1948 when Communism forced her out. She then moved to Formosa (the main island of Taiwan), where she served until her retirement. She was the Southern Baptist Convention's first missionary to Taiwan. After her retirement, Bertha Smith prayed for and ministered to pastors and other Christians up until her death in 1988. She retired from mission service in 1958 at age 70 but traveled extensively telling about her mission work. Smith founded the Peniel Prayer Center in Cowpens, SC, in 1973. She also authored books about her experiences as a missionary, \"Go Home and Tell\" and \"How the Spirit Filled My Life,\" and is the subject of a biography, \"Miss Bertha: Woman of Revival\" by Lewis Drummond.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

The results told him that he was best suited for a career in ministry or in entertainment. At the time, David's future goal was to live in a log cabin in the wilderness and live off the land for the rest of his life. The Lord, however, had different plans for David Servant.

The Puritans were a significant group of English Protestants in the 16th and 17th centuries, including, but not limited to, English Calvinists. Puritanism in this sense was founded by some Marian exiles from the clergy shortly after the accession of Elizabeth I of England in 1558, as an activist movement within the Church of England. <p>\r\nThe designation \"Puritan\" is often incorrectly used, based on the assumption that hedonism and puritanism are antonyms. Historically, the word was used pejoratively to characterise the Protestant group as extremists, similar to the Cathars of France and, according to Thomas Fuller in his Church History, dated back to 1564. Archbishop Matthew Parker of that time used it and \"precisian\" with the sense of the modern \"stickler\".<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

Glenn was saved in the early 70s through a revival that swept the nation called the Jesus Movement. Jesus found him in a park where he partied and dealt drugs. In this park he experienced a radical conversion (actually a normal one by Biblical standards). The Lord brought Glenn to a church that was reaping thousands out of the drug culture and he was privileged to live in a discipleship program for three years. He met and married his wife, Jessica and the Lord called them to start an outreach on the streets of Detroit, MI. In a short time the outreach became a church which they pastored for 12 years.<p>\r\nGlenn resigned this church to get a masters degree in Theology and Church History and pastored two other churches. In 1997, the Lord called Him to an evangelistic ministry; challenging the church and calling the lost to Jesus. Through Glennâ€™s stirring and compassionate preaching, saints and sinners alike are called to repentance, holiness, and intimacy with God. He challenges the church to examine themselves and determine if they are living out the revolutionary teachings of Jesus as he calls the lost to abandon their whole life to the One who demands wholehearted devotion. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ihpministry.com\">In His Presence Ministries<\/a> is the website ministry where you can access other resources by Glenn Muldrum.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

Unfortunately, we who are to be salt and light have neither stopped the cultural decay nor illumined the societal darkness. This is because the church has departed from God; we have fallen from our first love. Therefore, even now God is urging His people, \"Turn to Me with all your heart, With fasting, with weeping, and with mourning. So rend your heart, and not your garments; Return to the LORD your God...\" <p>\r\nThe purpose of this ministry of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.johnfranklinministries.org\">John Franklin Ministries<\/a> is to assist the church in what it will take for revival and spiritual awakening.  Just how do we return to God, humble ourselves, pray, seek His face, and turn from our wicked ways? How does this process work and what does it look like? What can we expect to happen in our day based on the record of the Bible and historical patterns of God's working? If we respond Joel 2:14 encourages us with the hope that the Lord may yet turn and leave behind a blessing. <br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

Michael served for nearly ten years with the Haggai Institute, traveling around the world more than 32 times, teaching courses in evangelism and church leadership to church leaders. He rose to the position of Managing Director at the age of 31. The family settled in Atlanta, and in 1984, Michael became a United States citizen, fulfilling a dream he had held for many years.<p>\r\nHe founded The <a href=\"http:\/\/apostles.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Church of The Apostles<\/a> in 1987 with fewer than 40 adults with the mission to \"Equip the Saints and Seek the Lost.\" The church has since grown to a congregation of over 3000.

Clearly God has uniquely equipped Dr. Youssef to speak to a worldwide audience. The path he has walked has given him a thorough cross-cultural understanding and a firm grasp of Scripture. He preaches, teaches and exhorts with a straightforward and uncompromising delivery, based on the authority of the inspired, infallible Word of God.

It was a very strict Christian home, he told Isaacson, \"We would get up in the morning, read the Bible, sing hymns, and go to church regularly. When I went to secondary school I lost interest in the church because our principal taught us atheism. But after a while I thought again and started going to various churches in town. Eventually, in 1963, a group of singers and preachers from a Gospel church got permission to come to the school. I understood the Gospel message, and was born again on April 5th, 1964. I read John Wesley, Charles Finney, Spurgeon, and lots of other books. I got involved with the Scripture Union, and I grew.\"<p>\r\nConcluding his book, Isaacson writes, \"And, of course, Deeper Life are self-governing. Kumuyi is the founder & General Superintendent, and he carries a tremendous weight in pastoring the Gbagada (Lagos) church alone, quite apart from the (now thousands) of other congregations across Nigeria and the rest of the world. He is a remarkable leader, one of God's people for this generation. Kumuyi has received a great deal from God, but he is adept at passing along what he receives. My feeling is that what God has given his people through Kumuyi will be kept and developed long after Kumuyi is gone. This has been God's work, and to Him be the glory.\" <br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

The Puritans were a significant group of English Protestants in the 16th and 17th centuries, including, but not limited to, English Calvinists. Puritanism in this sense was founded by some Marian exiles from the clergy shortly after the accession of Elizabeth I of England in 1558, as an activist movement within the Church of England. <p>\r\nThe designation \"Puritan\" is often incorrectly used, based on the assumption that hedonism and puritanism are antonyms. Historically, the word was used pejoratively to characterise the Protestant group as extremists, similar to the Cathars of France and, according to Thomas Fuller in his Church History, dated back to 1564. Archbishop Matthew Parker of that time used it and \"precisian\" with the sense of the modern \"stickler\".<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

A Tale Of Ancient Rome brings to fore the true essence of the Christian race. The history of the writing itself is illustrative of the route through which Faith has come from Christ to the present time. The route that has wound through shame and ridicule, but which like the hero of the tale, is bound to lead to glory.<p>\r\nThis tale of the catacomb is the story of true Christians. It puts to shame the sham of contemporary Christianity. By this book every man can judge the true worth of the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. Not by the church buildings scattered all around the nations most of which remain only as a reminded of the glory that was, nor by the showy bible teachers on cable TV.

Pastor Derek and Stacey Melton planted Pryor ON Fire Teen Ministries in 1991, having a deep burden to reach the troubled youth of our generation with the saving gospel of Jesus Christ. This burden soon gave birth to an opportunity for teens to begin meeting in a small classroom south of Pryor. This was the birth of Pryor ON Fire Teen Ministries. After a short time that small classroom was packed and overflowing so the meetings were moved to two different locations, both of which were outgrown. The ministry continued to expand and grow as Thunderbird Youth Academy began to bus their cadets to the services weekly to join with local youth. In January of 1999, Pastor Derek and Stacey once again, felt the undeniable burden of the Lord to plant a church for adults who had began to attend these teen services. Grace Life Church was born out of this burden. The ministry was then moved to 110 E. Graham, where the ministry has purchased two properties giving the ministry 14,000 sq. ft., and a sanctuary that will seat over 250. The ministry resides in this location today.<p>\r\nToday, Pastor Derek and Stacey continue to experience a deep burden for at-risk youth struggling in our generation, ministering Jesus Christ and His love to hurting teens several times per week. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gracelifepryor.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Grace Life Church<\/a> is also a godly presence in our city, as many families have found their place in this Christ exalting body of believers. These members are maturing in Christ from glory to glory.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

As an evangelist he has preached the Gospel extensively, in Northern Ireland and also in Scotland, and had previously worked alongside Bertie. The work commenced in a hall (formerly The Friends Meeting House) in Railway Street in November 1995 Meetings were held in a hall (formerly The Friends Meeting House) in Railway Street since November 1995 but regrettably they had to vacate the Railway Street premises in May 2008 and temporally, meetings are being held in a nearby city centre church.<p>\r\nThe Lifeboat Mission Lisburn is a non-denominational preaching house with the aim of winning souls to Jesus Christ, encouraging Christians towards a deeper walk with God and seeking God for an outpouring of His Holy Spirit on our land.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

The prayer meetings last as long as three hours each time. Significantly, those meetings are located at 90 Williams Street, only three blocks away from the Fulton Street location where Jeremiah Lanphier, a New York City businessman seeking the will of God for his generation, cried out from a small room in an obscure NYC church, \"Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?â€ The prayer meeting is also just three blocks from Ground Zero, the site of the World Trade Center, and directly across the street from the Federal Reserve.<p>\r\nPastor Bruce described the front of the church where the new Wall Street prayer meetings are being held. â€œOn the awning is an image of a cobblestone wall that represents what Wall Street looked like in 1857. Adjacent to that is the image of a modern brick wall. Running down the middle of that wall is a crack that indicates the breaking of the wall. It is a visual image of the statement that Jesus is breaking down the walls of partition. â€œThe noonday prayer meetings at Faith Evangelistic Mission that are going on right now are the foundation for the sort of building program that was led by Nehemiah.

Stephen has found through the saturation of the Word the message of the cross. It is beyond an event; it is a style. Thus, the cross is not a piece of wood or an emblem, but it is the heart of the person of Christ. Cross style is the Christ style. He must be central. As an international evangelist, he has taken this message to the world. Expositional preaching is cross cultural and meets the need on every level.<p>\r\nStephenâ€™s life, testimony, and preaching has been used throughout the last six decades to touch, influence, and transform the lives of countless people around the world. But in honest humility, Stephen downplays himself in order to lift up and â€œpushâ€ Jesus. His life is not his own; it is the stage upon which Christ acts, the glove Jesus wears, the voice through which Jesus proclaims Himself to the world, the hands Jesus uses to touch, minister, and love a hurting and needy world. Stephen is a Jesus pusher. He has no other focus than Christ.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n"

Dr. David Platt is the pastor of The Church at Brook Hills, a congregation in Birmingham, Alabama. David’s first love in ministry is disciple making—teaching God’s Word, mentoring others, and multiplying the gospel. “I believe that God has uniquely created every one of his people to impact the world,” he says. “Some may count this view as idealistic, but I believe it is thoroughly biblical—rooted in Psalm 67:1–2, yet found in Scripture from beginning to end. God is in the business of blessing his people so that his ways and his salvation might be made known among all people.” To this end, David has traveled throughout the United States and around the world, teaching the Bible and training church leaders.<p>\r\nDavid has earned two undergraduate degrees from the University of Georgia and three advanced degrees, including a doctor of philosophy from New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary. Prior to coming to Brook Hills, he served the seminary as dean of chapel and assistant professor of expository preaching and apologetics and was on staff at Edgewater Baptist Church in New Orleans. He is the founder of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.radical.net\/\">Radical<\/a>, a resource ministry, dedicated to serving the church in making disciples of all nations.

Was an American Methodist born in Indiana who joined the Salvation Army in the 1890s. He was mightily used of the Lord--even more so through his many books, which were chiefly written during a convalescence following being badly injured while street preaching. He was described by one observer as a kindly, literate and articulate man who left good memories with nearly everyone he met.<p>\r\nHe described his experience as being a full immersion in the love of God. He would later write of the experience: I walked out over Boston Common before breakfast, weeping for joy and praising God. Oh, how I loved! In that hour I knew Jesus, and I loved Him till it seemed my heart would break with love. I was filled with love for all His creatures. I heard the little sparrows chattering; I loved them. I saw a little worm wriggling across my path; I stepped over it; I didn't want to hurt any living thing. I loved the dogs, I loved the horses, I loved the little urchins on the street, I loved the strangers who hurried past me, I loved the heathen, I loved the whole world. This experience would become his life's focus as he taught and admonished believers to seek 'the blessing' on an international level.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

Lewis and known to his friends and family as \"Jack\", was a novelist, poet, academic, medievalist, literary critic, essayist, lay theologian, and Christian apologist born in Belfast, Ireland. He held academic positions at both Oxford University (Magdalen College), 1925â€“1954, and Cambridge University (Magdalene College), 1954â€“1963. He is best known both for his fictional work, especially The Screwtape Letters, The Chronicles of Narnia, and The Space Trilogy, and for his non-fiction Christian apologetics, such as Mere Christianity, Miracles, and The Problem of Pain.<p>\r\nLewis and fellow novelist J. R. R. Tolkien were close friends. Both authors served on the English faculty at Oxford University, and both were active in the informal Oxford literary group known as the \"Inklings\". According to his memoir Surprised by Joy, Lewis had been baptized in the Church of Ireland (part of the Anglican Communion) at birth, but fell away from his faith during his adolescence. Owing to the influence of Tolkien and other friends, at the age of 32 Lewis returned to the Anglican Communion, becoming \"a very ordinary layman of the Church of England\". His faith had a profound effect on his work, and his wartime radio broadcasts on the subject of Christianity brought him wide acclaim.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

Presbyterian preacher in colonial British America who defended religious dissent and helped lead the Southern phase of the religious revival known as the Great Awakening. Davies was educated at Samuel Blairâ€™s â€œlog collegeâ€ at Faggâ€™s Manor, Pa., and was ordained in 1747. His work during the Great Awakening centred at Hanover, Va.; in Virginia, where Presbyterians were persecuted as Nonconformists by the established church leaders, he became a chief defender of the Dissenters. He argued their cause before the Virginia general court and enlisted the support of prominent English and Scottish Dissenters. The governmentâ€™s preoccupations after the outbreak of the French and Indian War (1754), however, diminished concern over Davies, especially when his war sermons helped rouse Virginians to defend the frontier.<p>\r\nDavies further enhanced his reputation as the outstanding preacher of his day by sermons given in England and Scotland during a trip with the evangelist Gilbert Tennent. Soon after his return Davies became the first moderator of the first presbytery of Virginia, Hanover, in 1755. On the same trip Davies raised funds in England for the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) and was its fourth president from 1759 until his death.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n"

To address this, Stanford published numerous papers during the 1980s and 1990s clarifying the distinctive tenets of \"Pauline Dispensationalism.\" A collection of fourteen papers were collected into his 1993 book of the same name.

The Westminster Shorter Catechism is a catechism written in 1646 and 1647 by the Westminster Assembly, a synod of English and Scottish theologians and laymen intended to bring the Church of England into greater conformity with the Church of Scotland. The assembly also produced the Westminster Confession of Faith and the Westminster Larger Catechism. A version without Scripture citations was completed on 25 November 1647 and presented to the Long Parliament, and Scripture citations were added on 14 April 1648.<p>\r\nThe purpose of the Shorter Catechism is to educate children and others \"of weaker capacity\" (according to a preface written by the Church of Scotland) in the Reformed faith. It is based on the Larger Catechism, which was intended for use by ministers as they taught the faith to their congregations in preaching. The Catechism is in a question and answer format, which had been popularized by Martin Luther as a way to help children learn the meaning of the material, rather than simply memorizing the Lord's Prayer, Ten Commandments, and Apostles' Creed as had been the practice prior to the Reformation.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

Was a 20th-century Methodist Christian missionary and theologian. He is remembered chiefly for his interreligious lectures to the educated classes in India, thousands of which were held across the Indian subcontinent during the first decades of the 20th century. According to his and other contemporary reports, his friendship for the cause of Indian self-determination allowed him to become a friend of leaders of the up-and-coming Indian National Congress party. He spent much time with Mohandas K. Gandhi, and the Nehru family. Gandhi challenged Jones and, through Jones' writing, the thousands of Western missionaries working there during the last decades of the British Raj, to include greater respect for the mindset and strengths of the Indian character in their work.<p>\r\nHis work became interdenominational and world-wide. He helped to re-establish the Indian â€œAshramâ€ (or forest retreat) as a means of drawing men and women together for days at a time to study in depth their own spiritual natures and quest, and what the different faiths offered individuals. In 1930, along with a British missionary and Indian pastor and using the sound Christian missionary principle of indigenization. (Godâ€™s reconciliation to mankind through Jesus on the cross. He made Him visible as the Universal Son of Man who had come for all people. This opening up of nations to receiving Christ within their own framework marked a new approach in missions called \"indigenization\") Dr. Jones reconstituted the â€œAshramâ€ with Christian disciplines. This institution became known as the â€Christian Ashram.â€<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

His chief jealousy is for God to be glorified in the Church; for a \"demonstration of the manifold wisdom of God\" to be given through the lives of His people, as they orient their lives around the Gospel and find their ultimate satisfaction in Him.<p>\r\nTo this end he preaches and writes with an especial emphasis on the supremacy of Christ, the knowledge of God, the centrality of the Cross, the mystery of Israel and the Church, prayer and the abiding life, biblical manhood and womanhood, the glories of marriage and parenting, the Church as community, and a recovery of the apostolic witness unto Israel, and to the \"uttermost parts of the earth.\" He has been happily married since 1998, and is the father of five beautiful children.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

Dr. Cook holds a Master of Divinity degree in Missions from Canadian Theological Seminary and a Doctor of Missiology degree from Fuller Theological Seminary, School of World Mission. Dr. Cook wrote Historical Drift, a guide to restoring spiritual passion in the Church. Only after 1941 with the establishing of the Western Canadian Bible Institute in Regina, did the Canadian C&MA experience rapid and solid growth especially West of Winnipeg. After Simpson's death in 1919 the transition to new leadership was rocky. Paul Radar, his successor, was unable to balance pastoring his large Chicago church with his role as president.<p>\r\nProphetic preaching has all but vanished as some pastors look for \"a more positive eschatology\" than what Simpson taught. The most mentioned prophetic event in Scripture is the \"millennium.\" As Alliance people we come from a tradition where the missionary task is linked with the imminent premillenial return of Christ. e.g. \"And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations (ta ethna--people groups), and then the end will come\" (Matt. 24:14). Simpson actually believed we could hasten Christ's return by finishing the one clear task He left us, i.e. evangelization of the world (Matt. 28:18-20). What has changed? His coming is 124 years closer than when the C&MA began (1887). The unfinished task has been more quantified and identified. I am encouraged by our continued focus on the \"least reached peoples.\" But have we lost this powerful motif--of bringing back the Coming King as the New Testament promises? But I believe we can be renewed and empowered to impact our world as a small denomination which has chosen to make \"Christ's last command our first concern\" for 124 years. But our response to these Biblical foundational truths must not change: 1) \"I the Lord change not\" (Mal. 3:6). 2) He has spoken to every generation through His infallible unchanging Word. 3) The need of human nature is still the same. Many of us have been innovators, changing our methods but not the message. This takes both spiritual discernment and a tenacious commitment to Scripture. Too often new media or strategies subtly change the message.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

Hattie Philletta Hammond was born in Williamsport, Maryland, in 1907. She was always aware of the call of God on her life and at first wanted to be a missionary. When her cousins would come for a visit, they would play Sunday school and church, converting and baptizing all the dolls in the neighborhood. She would preach to cows and chickens and to herself in the mirror. At school she gave out tracts and knew more about the map of Africa than the map of America. When she was 12, Hattie was stricken with typhoid fever and was not expected to live. Her pastor was led to anoint her with oil and pray. Soon, her 106-degree fever broke, and from that moment, Hattie began to get well. Still religiously inclined during her early teens, Hattie nevertheless found church life unsatisfying and would sneak off to take part in worldly activities. One day, at age 15, she passed a tent where Rev. John J. Ashcroft, grandfather of Senator John Ashcroft, was holding evangelistic services. She was drawn to the meetings and eventually went inside, where she was gloriously converted and baptized in the Holy Spirit.<p>\r\nHattie then became a bold witness. She preached to anyone in her high school who would listen. No longer shy and attracted by the things of the world, Hattie dedicated her life to full-time ministry at 16. After the Martinsburg meetings, Hattie was preaching at a church in Cleveland, Ohio, when again the power of God fell. Everywhere she went, remarkable miracles of healing took place. As a result, she became known as \"the girl evangelist\" and in 1927 was ordained by the Assemblies of God. By the 1930s, she had become one of the most powerful speakers in the Pentecostal movement. Her message was simple, inspiring total abandonment and consecration to God.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

He spent between 15 minutes and six hours daily alone with God in what he called Daily Dynamic Encounters with God (DDEWG). During these DDEWG he read Godâ€™s Word, meditated on it, listened to Godâ€™s voice, heard God speak to him, recorded what God was saying to him and prayed it through. He thus had over 18,000 DDEWG. He also had over 60 periods of withdrawing to seek God alone for periods that ranged from 3 to 21 days (which he termed Retreats for Spiritual Progress). The time he spent seeking God slowly transformed him into a man who hungered, thirsted and panted after God.

Campbell Morgan was one of the leading evangelical preachers of his day. He began preaching at age 13 and by age 26 was teaching at the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, Illinois. He returned to England in 1904 to become pastor at Westminster Chapel in London. He was a contemporary and friend Martyn Lloyd-Jones, F. B. Meyer and Charles Spurgeon.\r\n<p>\r\nIn this book, Morgan examines the letters to the seven churches of Asia which begin the book of Revelation in the New Testament.  Over 1900 years have passed, and yet our churches today face many of the same temptations, struggles and challenges as those faced by these first century believers.  Morgan brings home how the messages of Jesus to these early churches are equally applicable to our churches today.  Would our own church receive Jesusâ€™ praise? Or does our church need to answer Jesusâ€™ call to repent and return to true worship?  (Introduction by MaryAnn)\r\n<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

Together with Pamphilus, he was a scholar of the Biblical canon and is regarded as an extremely well learned Christian of his time.[1] He wrote Demonstrations of the Gospel, Preparations for the Gospel, and On Discrepancies between the Gospels, studies of the Biblical text. As \"Father of Church History\" he produced the Ecclesiastical History, On the Life of Pamphilus, the Chronicle and On the Martyrs.<p>\r\nThe work as a whole has been lost in the original Greek, but it may be reconstructed from later chronographists of the Byzantine school who made excerpts from the work, especially George Syncellus. The tables of the second part have been completely preserved in a Latin translation by Jerome, and both parts are still extant in an Armenian translation. The loss of the Greek originals has given an Armenian translation a special importance; thus, the first part of Eusebius' Chronicle, of which only a few fragments exist in the Greek, has been preserved entirely in Armenian, though with lacunae.

He was the bishop of Hippo Regius (modern-day Annaba, Algeria), located in Numidia (Roman province of Africa). He is viewed as one of the most important Church Fathers in Western Christianity for his writings in the Patristic Era. Among his most important works are City of God and Confessions.<p>\r\nAccording to his contemporary, Jerome, Augustine \"established anew the ancient Faith.\" In his early years, he was heavily influenced by Manichaeism and afterward by the Neo-Platonism of Plotinus. After his baptism and conversion to Christianity in 387, Augustine developed his own approach to philosophy and theology, accommodating a variety of methods and perspectives. Believing that the grace of Christ was indispensable to human freedom, he helped formulate the doctrine of original sin and made seminal contributions to the development of just war theory. When the Western Roman Empire began to disintegrate, Augustine developed the concept of the Catholic Church as a spiritual City of God, distinct from the material Earthly City. His thoughts profoundly influenced the medieval worldview.

He strongly disputed the claim that freedom from God's punishment for sin could be purchased with money. He confronted indulgence salesman Johann Tetzel, a Dominican friar, with his Ninety-Five Theses in 1517. His refusal to retract all of his writings at the demand of Pope Leo X in 1520 and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Worms in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the Pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the Emperor.<p>\r\nLuther taught that salvation and subsequently eternity in heaven is not earned by good deeds but is received only as a free gift of God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ as redeemer from sin and subsequently eternity in hell. His theology challenged the authority and office of the Pope by teaching that the Bible is the only source of divinely revealed knowledge from God and opposed sacerdotalism by considering all baptized Christians to be a holy priesthood. Those who identify with these, and all of Luther's wider teachings, are called Lutherans even though Luther insisted on Christian as the only acceptable name for individuals who professed Christ.

This is an excerpted translation into Greek of an earlier Arabic text. The Arabic original contains a prologue not found in most other translations, and was written by an Arab monk, Michael. Michael explained that he decided to write his biography in 1084 because none was available in his day. However, the main Arabic text seems to have been written by an earlier author sometime between the early 9th and late 10th centuries AD. Written from a hagiographical point of view and prone to exaggeration and some legendary details, it is not the best historical source for his life, but is widely reproduced and considered to contain elements of some value. The hagiographic novel Barlaam and Josaphat, traditionally attributed to John, is in fact a work of the 10th century.<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

He held a Master of Arts degree in Religion, and Doctorates of Divinity and Theology, and in 1964 was accepted into the Presbyterian Church; to this day he is the only man ever to have been admitted into the Presbyterian ministry without first going through Knox College.

He not only pioneered several churches, but traveled to many churches throughout the country where spontaneous visitations of God would break forth.  He founded a Bible School in the city of Mar del Plata, Argentina, where for several years there was an unusual move of the Holy Spirit and a manifestation of Godâ€™s Presence. Many of the students went on to serve the Lord, founding churches in many provinces of the country.<p>\r\nDr. Miller also began an orphanage for abandoned children, which became very well known in the city of Mar del Plata.  By faith, God brought in offerings to construct all the buildings. The Millers remained in Argentina until 1974, strengthening the Peniel churches and working with their sons, Robert and John, and adoptive daughter Annie. The Holy Spirit had spoken to the Millers, telling them that they were to go forth to churches in various other nations to strengthen their faith for an onward move into the purposes of God.  So in March 1974, they left the work in Argentina to move into a larger harvest field.  For the next six and one-half years they traveled around the world several times, ministering in numerous countries, including Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, the Middle East and the United Kingdom.

He grew up in a single-parent home with no Christian influence.  <p>\r\nHis great strength was that of evangelism, and he took every opportunity possible to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ. His favorite pulpits were the marketplace, the roadside, and under shade trees. Wherever he could gather a crowd of people, he would preach.  Many times he used very unorthodox ways to speak to his congregation.  He relates one experience of preaching in a market area surrounded by a large crowd with three Brahmim priests in the midst of the crowd.  They were bare to the waist and wearing their sacred thread, and their foreheads were well smeared with sandalwood paste.  After Silas had preached, one of the priests approached him and, with his finger pointed to Silas' face, began quoting the Vedas, a Hindu holy book, in Sanskrit. Silas said he didn't understand a thing that was being said, and the priests were successful in turning the crowd with their words. They reasoned that if this man could not understand the holy sayings of the gods, why should they bother to listen to him.

His ministry involved large tent crusades, taking him to the far north eastern tribes of Assam, down to the cape of India and out into surrounding Asian countries.<p>\r\nIn 1971 he left this ministry in the hands of gifted Indian ministers and became the International director of Ambassadors for Christ International, dedicated to \"revival in the churches and evangelism through the churches\".

From a young age, Keith's heart has carried a God-given burden for genuine Heaven-sent revival. After salvation his next earliest memory at the age of five was a vision in which the Lord showed him a coming outpouring of the Holy Spirit. The first Pentecostal Church which his parents attended in the early 1960's was birthed out of a genuine outpouring. Since 2001, Keith has laboured with School of Christ International founded by B.H. Clendennen in 1992. SOC has spread across the world from the Steps of the Kremlin to the Amazon Jungle in more than 150 nations. The fruit has been tens of thousands of new Churches, numerous new leaders sent forth, as well as mature leaders encouraged and strengthened.\r\n<p>\r\nThere is yet much work to be accomplished in Europe. Keith desires to see at least one school running each year in each country (or language), each with a national director. There is presently still work to be accomplished in translating the SOC into the remaining European languages. Since joining himself to the work of the School, he has called Europe the Prodigal Continent.

They began by pouring out their lives among abandoned street children, and as the Holy Spirit moved miraculously in many ways a revival movement spread to adults, pastors, churches and then throughout the bush all across Mozambiqueâ€™s ten provinces.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><\/td><\/tr><\/TABLE><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"
