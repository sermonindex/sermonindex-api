Often times it may well just be one area that remains but nonetheless folks continue in that sin.  Wilkerson preaches a very personal message here and he shares his heart and shows his own weakness as an example.  The consequences for a Christian continuing in sin are sobering, but he gave us what we needed to overcome sin, if we want to. For those who are sick of their sin, and hate it, and cry out to God, there is wonderful news. He will empower you, and he wants to put his fear in your heart so you will not turn away from him, and then he can take you into the fullness of the new covenant. Powerful preaching, with a gentle compassion for those who are struggling. \r\n"

Tozer preached on this date, the other being “The New Year As God Sees It,” which he delivered shortly before midnight. In the morning message, he focuses on 1 Corinthians 16:13-14, and upon the critical importance of staying watchful. A sure way to let one’s guard down is to believe that the Devil does not exist. The pastor goes on to contemplate masculine and feminine virtues, and reads from what he considers to be the most disturbing chapter of the Bible, 1 Corinthians 13:1-7. He concludes with three things that will make us strong: 1) the Spirit’s infilling; 2) the Lord’s indwelling; 3) prayer and the Scriptures. The length of the sermon is 42 minutes and 15 seconds."

He then considers the men who first received this commission, and the necessity of their transformation at Pentecost. Our attention is then drawn to the Christ of the Great Commission, especially his unlimited, unhindered, unending authority over all (v.18). Jesus referred to himself as the Son of Man many times, to show us who he really was, the fulfilment of Daniel’s vision (Dan.7:13,14). There is only one true King and kingdom in the world today; lose sight of his sovereignty, and you lose the hope of missions. Finally Mr. Washer examines the commission itself - its foundation, commands, and effects - and asks whether our own lives and ministries are worthy of being exported to nations that have already been ravaged and confused by our false doctrines, false gospels, false evangelists, carnality and worldliness. He ends with a passionate plea for missions and missionaries, and an exhortation to confidence in the One who said, “Lo, I am with you alway” (v.20). That’s not a promise, he says, it’s a FACT.

The Church must never employ the world's methods, for God will only bless the obedience of his people."

Since God's sovereignty does not nullify man's responsibility, Campbell admonished his hearers to be \"agents of revival\" that take God up on \"His covenant engagement\" in prayer and staying close to the heart of the Shepherd."

With limited speaking abilities, he surpassed the most eloquent orators. Armed with only a Bible and the breath of heaven on his ministry, he preached to America until she turned back to God in a great revival, and then he jumped across the Atlantic to rock the British Isles with one of the greatest moves of God ever seen.

Some worldly philosophers define conscience as the culmination of all the good behaviors learned over childhood from parents. But the Scriptures talk about conscience as being from God.

There comes a time when God doesn't have to speak anymore because you already know what He wants you to do. God says put away the old man and put away the old nature. He is seeking for a man after His own heart who would simply walk in obedience with Him. Are you embracing something that God has clearly told you to put away?

This type of machine is called a Von Neummann machine, and is incredibly complex to develop and requires millions of individual moving components, as well as the information to drive them.  In this analogy we see that man is an incredibly complex machine, obviously designed, and if he\/she is designed, then they are also designed to operate in a certain fashion.

So also, we are able to interact with eternal realities by inference.  Through this analogy, Smith reveals the lie concerning our inability to scientifically measure heaven or hell to prove it's existence because you cannot scientifically tamper with a black hole in any way yet scientists believe in them just the same.   The second analogy he explains about dimensionality is that a two dimensional person would be incapable of capturing a three dimensional person, because they would always use their higher dimensionality to give their captors the slip.

He shows how environment will optimize genetics to the fullest extent of the genes latent capacities.  He directly relates this to the environment of the family, emphasizing how an unhealthy environment for a child will hinder his\/her genetic capacity throughout life.  We need to have our hearts plowed and prepared for eternal truths, too much stimulation upon our hearts, newspapers, television, and the like, wears pathways across our heart-soil.  The seed of the word will be cast upon hardened soil if we do not take the time to quietly see our hearts and lives plowed up by the quite time with the Lord.  Another way to till the soil is fellowship with believers.   Our spiritual environment needs to be such that the seed can grow in health."

		"description" : " In the debate between creation vs. evolution, the fundamental nail in evolution theories coffin is the field of study known as information science.  All existing life exists as a result of information, organized information.  Statistical analysts understand that information does not arise by chance.  AE Wilder-Smith shows in this discussion how to understand information theory, and how it proves creationism to be the only logical viewpoint.  Matter is not self-organizing; it is merely a medium for information.   Smith discusses the classic debate between Bishop Wilberforce and Aldous Huxley concerning the watch-maker.  He shows the fallacy of Huxley’s argument.  If you are not familiar with this debate it is a rather essential understanding in order to unravel the Gordian-Knot of evolution theory.  Smith argues in this teaching how important creationism understandings are because man is accountable to God upon the basis of God being revealed through nature."

It starts with Romans 13 and moves through many Scriptures dealing with authority, submission, and obedience. Kaung shows that only God deserves complete obedience and that he must be obeyed at all costs. The main message of the sermon can be summed up in this quote from the message: \"God is the only authority in the Universe.  There is no authority whatsoever except God himself -- and what God has given. …  There is so much misunderstanding about authority; we mistake something that’s commonly accepted as authorities (sic) without really knowing what authority really is. … God is the one and only authority. Any professed authority that is not from God -- that is not God himself -- is not real authority, because God is the only authority in the whole universe. … The more you give, the more authority you have.  The Lord Jesus said, ‘I gave myself a ransom for many.’ Because he gave himself as a ransom for many, the many come under his authority. If you want to be the first among your brothers and sisters, then you have to be a bond-slave, not only to Christ, but to your brothers and sisters.”"

In this sermon, we look at what it truly means to be in unity with Christ and his Body. We find that there are five different groups in the organized church:\r\n\r\n1) Those who have met the \"forgiving Christ.\" That is, they have \"accepted Jesus\" primarily to escape hell, suffering, and punishment. \r\n2) Those who have met the \"utilitarian Christ.\" That is, they have found that God can help them get what they need -- their whole interest in Christianity is that they should be taken care of by faith. \r\n3) Those who have met the \"status-giving Christ.\" These have joined the Church because they wanted fellowship and to be around the people. Position within the group is also typically very important within this group, and any achievement is hailed as part of the \"glory of God.\"\r\n4) Those who have met the \"emotion-satisfying Christ.\" Their whole purpose in Christianity and religion is to satisfy their emotional needs. They look for everything that will make them laugh, cry, or both.\r\n5) Those \"who have met the Holy God and the Sovereign Christ.\" They have seen their terrible sinfulness and have known forgiveness, their prayers have been answered, they have found status as God's Children, and they have been filled with the Joy of God. But in addition to all this, this group is living only for God's glory and to walk according to the Cross. Only this fifth group is the true Church of God. \r\n\r\nAny attempt to revive or unite all five groups will fail, but the fifth group can truly be one and bring glory to God."

This was the opposite of Satan whose character was one of possessiveness and unlawful ambition. The Lord Jesus emptied Himself and through His cross destroyed the work of the devil. To have the mind of Christ means that we know how to let go of even our own rights. This is the principle of the cross. The climax of the risen life is the cross.

This sermon examines the \"dark side of prayer\" -- that is, God's response to prayer from impure hearts and unclean hands. Prayer from an unrepentant and selfish heart will produce judgment rather than stopping it. The starting point for the message is God's judgment upon Nadab and Abihu in Leviticus 10 for offering \"strange fire\" on the altar of incense. This is a must-listen in this day of frequent calls to prayer -- prayer without repentance will do nothing but hasten judgment."

These are Christians who focus on material provision for the satisfying of their own desires. They are masters of their own destiny, choosing their own course, thus becoming their own god. Embracing the truth is about eternity and when we don't embrace truth we become imposters in the house of God. The imposter will create his own covering and create his own righteousness. The Holy Spirit is calling His church out of the sin of compromise and to come under the covering of the blood of Jesus. God is calling you out today to cover you and to take away your shame. Don't hide from His love!"

Many do not get through to God because they are seeking their own agenda, or their own personal well being rather than the purpose of Christ. The reason so many walk in confusion is because of this refusal to submit to God. Why do Christians not pray as they should? Are they not totally surrendered to following Jesus? Do they not understand the heart of God and his love for them? This unjust judge had authority in Luke 18 over this widow woman's adversary, and she knew her rights, and she did not give up. The devil accuses us, pointing out our faults, and God avenges us by giving us the very thing we lack, when we seek him for it.

The meek man Moses could not lead the children into the promised land, because of one instance of anger.  There is a warning to us in this example.  We can miss the opportunity to lead family, friends, and others to the Lord by one instance of walking out of the character of Christ.  Carter used Mathew 11:28 when Jesus said, “I am meek and lowly of heart.”  Carter also used Mathew 5 Jesus said, “blessed are the meek” but the main text he used was the story of Moses hitting the rock in anger and the inability of Moses to then lead others into the promised land."

It is only in strong weather that a man gets faith.\" Spurgeon then offers a striking and wonderful appeal to the \"pew-warmer,\" which I am compelled to include: Do you want to get your faith strong? Use it. You lazy lie-a-bed Christians, that go up to your churches and chapels, and take your seats, and hear our sermons, and talk about getting good, but never think about doing good; ye that are letting hell fill beneath you, and yet are too idle to stretch out your hands to pluck brands from the eternal burning; ye that see sin running down your streets, yet can never put so much as your foot to turn or stem the current, I wonder not that you have to complain of the littleness of your faith. It ought to be little; you do but little. And why should God give you more strength than you mean to use. Strong faith must always be an exercised faith."

He takes use of many examples of people who try to get into heaven with money, with price. He explains how many people without God spend their days trying not to focus on Eternity, and trying to focus instead on the temporal. He charges the person thus without God to instead dare ponder his own soul's destination, that he will spend forever in Hell until he turns to the cross of Christ.

The Cross doesn’t promise that when we agree to walk with God that the storms in our lives will cease. The Cross doesn’t offer a “mountain top” religion with all glory and no pain. There is nothing pretty or desirable about the Cross. Nobody wants to suffer or have the deepest issues of their heart uprooted. Nevertheless the Cross must become central to a Christian's life. When we choose to identify with the Cross we are choosing to die to a self-centered life and to live a life that is others-centered. Sometimes the biggest Cross we have to bear is coming to terms with the fact that we cannot bear our cross in our own strength. Give up your “power” to help yourself and let God's power lift you up and take you where you cannot go in your own strength."

In this wonderful sermon, Spurgeon enlarges upon the \"love that God hath to us,\" which we have \"known and believed.\" He discourses here on \"knowing\" God's love for you, and \"believing\" in it, a two-fold experience. On knowing God's love for us, Spurgeon says that through seeing it in our lives, feeling it through the intimacy of Christ, and lastly through the witness of the Spirit do we come to know it. Then, there are seasons when \"all strength and hope are gone,\" and we \"behold nothing but the uttermost depths of despair.\" Now this person may not know God's love for him, but he can still believe in it. \"To believe it when you do not feel it, is the noblest,\" Spurgeon says. Then he expands on how God's love to us is undeserved, for there \"was nothing in us that could have caused it,\" there was never \"anything in us by nature that he could love.\" Oh, What an amazing thought to ponder on! Furthermore he says, \"the love of God towards us is free, sovereign, undeserved, and springs entirely from the overflowing love of his own heart, and is not caused by anything in us.\" "

Men die and then they rot; thank God for the birth that is incorruptible and never dies!

He explains, “The father, as the paternal source of the family, and thus as head of the family, and naturally as protector, defender, and bread winner of the family, was the first ruler.” Human government thus developed from the idea of the family. Furthermore, God’s Truth transcends all politics and human government. The pastor concludes with the beautiful words of Hebrews 12:22-24.

One should never mistake external uniformity for true inward unity, nor confuse empty etiquette with authentic courtesy, nor exalt rigid principles above concern for people and a supreme commitment to Christ the Lord. “Be Ye All of One Mind” was recorded in Chicago, Illinois, on Sunday, April 11, 1954.

W. Tozer explores 1 Peter 4:1-5 with ironclad logic, tempered by his distinctive spark of congenial wit. He contemplates the meaning of “strange,” defines a Christian and the Christian perspective of time, and extols the virtues of a silent reply.

Tozer demolishes several dark misrepresentations of First Peter 3:18-24 and 4:6, by shining upon them the brilliant light of the rest of God’s Word. “Let me give you a good working rule for the understanding of Scripture: if you haven’t more than one verse to support it, don’t teach it.

Its length is 34 minutes and 43 seconds. \r\n\r\nIt is recommended that you follow along with the [url=https:\/\/www.sermonindex.net\/modules\/articles\/index.php?view=article&aid=18521]text transcription[\/url] of this sermon, as the sound quality makes listening difficult in some places.\r\n"

		"description" : "“Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you…” In the 30th message of this delightful, 34-part series on 1 Peter, A. W. Tozer observes three ways to bear adversity, from verses 12 to 19 of chapter 4. He then warns with Peter that “the Christian faith is not to provide immunity for wrongdoers… The deacon who doesn’t pay his bills, the pastor who leaves the city owing debts, he can not, he dare not, hide these evils behind clerical immunity, or Christian immunity.” Dr. Tozer concludes on a note of powerfully compelling evangelism, with masterful analogies to support Peter’s exhortation that we “commit the keeping” of our souls to a faithful creator. The sermon was delivered on June 27, 1954, at Southside Alliance Church in Chicago, Illinois. Its length is 28 minutes and 50 seconds. "

When you are in love with Christ, it draws people to you. The joy it brings will make people around you sit up and take notice. And the joy of the Lord is your strength. Soul winning is the heart of Christ in you reaching out to the lost around you. Without intimate time alone with God you cannot be a soul winner.  You have to get close to God and be led by his Spirit."

A convicting message on dealing with our prejudices. By the way believers live their lives they represent Christ to the world who watches with suspicion. Peter had a hard time dealing with the acceptance of the Gentiles, and learning to share God with them. The Jews had long held the belief God was theirs alone. The Lord revolutionized Peter's and the apostles' thinking when he gave the Holy Ghost to the Gentiles, too. May he revolutionize ours as well. This is one of the best messages on unity in the Body of Christ, and the need for it, ever preached by anyone. "

Go and touch his eyes that he may see, and speak to the dead and deaf with the voice of God and make them hear.

But amidst all your joys don't forget the sons and daughters of misery. Do you ever visit them?  Come away and let us make a call or two. Here is a home, six in family, they eat and drink and sleep and sick and die in the same chamber. Here is a drunkard hovel, void of furniture, wife a skeleton, children in rags; father now sleeping, the victims of his neglect. Here are the unemployed, wandering about, seeking work and finding none. Yonder are the wretched criminals cradled in crime passing in and out of the prisons all the time. There are the Daughter of shame deceived and wronged and ruined.  Traveling down the dark and blind to an early grave. There are the children, fighting in the gutter, going hungry to school. Growing up to fill their parents places.  Brought it all on themselves, you say?  Perhaps so.  But that does not excuse our assisting them. You don?t demand a certificate of virtue before you drag some drowning creature out of the water.  Nor the assurance in a man of faded grace before you deliver him from the burning building.  But what shall we do?  Content ourselves by singing a hymn? Offering a prayer? Or giving a little good advice?  NO!  Ten thousand times no!  We will forgive them.  Feed them! Reclaim them.  Employ them!Perhaps we shall fail with many.   Quite likely.  But our business is to help them all the same.  And that in the most practical, economical and Christlike manner.

Many will fight for prayer in their schools, yet do not pray at home. Hard times are coming before the Lord comes for his people, and those who do not pray won't be ready or able to face it. People are too busy to pray, they praise the Lord but don't pray to him. He is a stranger among them in his own house. Convicting!!!!"

John the Apostle warned, \"Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world\" (1 John 4:1). This warning is particularly relevant today, as Christianity is undergoing a paradigm shift of major proportions — a shift from faith to feelings; from fact to fantasy; and from reason to esoteric revelation.

Dr. Tozer then considers who we might want to thank some day for the gifts that they gave to Jesus. The wise men gave gold (lasting treasure), frankincense (worship), and myrrh (bitter sacrifice); Mary gave her mortal body; Joseph gave his faith; the shepherds gave their reverent wonder; Lazarus and his sisters, Mary and Martha, gave the welcome of their home; the women following Jesus gave a seamless, linen robe; and Joseph of Arimathaea gave his own, new grave. These are the gifts that they gave to Jesus. What might we give him that we might not be outdone in giving?"

In this message Carter shows how God allows his people to go through hard times so that they later are able to trust the Lord in the situations that they will go through in the future. Paul’s life was also used in a parallel to the disciples to show how God uses trials to mold the people of God. His points are that there is a coming storm that God will allow and it is those people that learn trust in the current trials that they are going through that will be used in this future storm. The people who will be used in the future storm are the man or woman of God that can say {I believe God} when the storm is happening."

From 1807 to 1827, laboring in the pulpit of Second Church in Portland, Maine, he saw extraordinary success in the conversion and edification of souls. He was held in such esteem, that thousands named their sons after him, and prayed that they would grow up to be like him. He preached the same biblical Calvinism that the Puritans preached before him. His written sermons are remarkably easy to read, even today. They are characterized by great vividness and convicting power, and by a captivating eloquence. This sermon is an excellent example of Puritan evangelism. Payson's goal is to convince the sinner that his salvation does not lie -- as he assumes -- within his own power. Armed with a deep knowledge of the deceitful heart of man, he drives the sinner from his refuge of lies, leaving him painfully aware of his ruined and helpless state, knowing that his only hope is in the mercy of a Sovereign God.

Leonard Ravenhill describes the judgment day from Scripture as a court day  where the verdict is final. He first points to the judgment of the unjust and then focusses on the judgment of the righteous. He emphasizes that we will all stand before Jesus alone and will not only be judged for what we have done, but also for what we have not done that we should have done. He denounces the worldliness of the people of God who invest their time and money as the world does - thus building on wood, hay and stubble as opposed to silver, gold and precious stones. Leonard Ravenhill strongly opposes today's \"sloppy gospel\" and \"sloppy evangelism\"  of a love with no judgment. He warns that we are passing from the mercy of the lamb to the wrath of the lamb when Jesus judges the earth and mercy will be gone forever. As the work of every human being shall be tried in the fire, many public ministries will go down in ashes. Leonard describes 95 % of believers as bound by superstition and theology. He criticizes the unjust money-making of public ministries that leads to false investments of large amounts of money. He states that we must have Jesus take the government over our lives in reality and be lost and consumed in Him. Ravenhill closes his sermon with a strong call to repentance: \"If we cannot live as a different breed of people on this earth we have no right to live here. God stamp eternity on my eyeballs.\""

Two of Carter’s examples were people that had failed.  One was the high priest Joshua, standing before the throne of God in filthy rags had failed to build the temple.  The word picture about Joshua is a typical picture of Christ putting robes of righteousness on the sinner who comes to him.  This priest in filthy garments, who stands before the throne of God and then being given clean garments is compared to a Christian, who in the honesty of who he or she is, comes to Christ and receives garments of righteousness..  Another person of failure was Jacob at Bethel, who in being a liar, really didn’t have the blessing until he admitted who he really was. In other words, when these two people came to and end of what they could do, they admitted their failings.  Carter’s main text was in John 1:45, where a third example was the honest man Nathaniel.  Nathaniel recognizes who Christ is when Christ describes Nathaniel by stating that he is a man of no guile who he saw under the fig tree.  Nathaniel recognizes Christ when hearing this because he knew that Jesus was describing something that could only by said by the Messiah."

God said, if you could break my covenant with the night and day, then my covenant with David can be broken. v15: The first part has been fulfilled in Jesus. In the second part, God promises that He will never lack ministers (Levites) to minister before Him. In spite of all those who are quitting the ministry, God is still raising up His Levitical Priesthood. There are two streams, 2 concurrent types of priesthoods. Ezekiel prophesied that in the last days there'll be two kinds of congregations, preachers and ministers. There will be those who minister unto God. In Ez 40-44, Ezekiel has the vision of a great temple that was to be built. That is not a physical temple, because it stretches over lands and seas and mountains. He is talking about the church of the last days. He sees the church as having no boundaries. And the glory of the Lord is coming down on that house\/temple. But Ezekiel saw a strange, horrifying sight. Despite the glory, a rebellious priesthood came forth. The Levitical priesthood were to guard and cleanse the gates of the tabernacle. Nothing evil was to be allowed into the temple."

He was anointed to speak the mind of God. God made him this promise. \"I have made you a defensed, impregnable city, against the priests and all the people. They will fight against you, but will not prevail.\" Then, these amazing words. \"Speak, lest I confound you before the people\". No man was more sure of his calling, and God called him to speak of destruction and desolation, but if he should doubt, he shall be confounded. I.e. If you trust me you will never be confounded, but if you will doubt your call from Me, I'll confound you before men. This is crucial in today's world. I have been preaching for over 50 years, but still remember the day, time and place where God called me. I have never once doubted that call. If a person cannot say to God, \"I'm in your will and your place\", then you will be confounded."

Those who have been in the heavenly places with Christ, and are overcoming believers. They are overcoming the flesh, the devil, and the world. They walk in the power of the Spirit and their heart is not here but in heaven with Jesus, and their mind is on heavenly things. God has a controversy when the nations of this world mistreat His Son's Body. Sinners and hypocrites in Zion will be afraid when God begins to move and shake things. They won't be prepared for there is no security unless you are IN CHRIST. Unless your life is hid in Him, and you are dead to this world and it's vain attractions. The enemy is coming in like a flood against God's people, but remember, He sits, as KING of the flood."

He points out there is a similarity in both Psalms except for the beginning verses.  Carter’s main point is that in David’s maturity he became a man of a fixed heart and is singing a song of victory in Psalm 108 instead of singing out a song of circumstances and difficulties in Psalm 60.  In this message, Carter brings out promises that are in types that were given to David and are of course given to us too.  We can wake up having a testimony of a fixed heart and singing a song of victory instead of waking up singing a song of our circumstances and having a testimony of the troubles around us.  We can sing a song of victory and have a testimony of a fixed heart if we can realize that we have promises that God will give us the victory through Jesus Christ."

From Matthew 21 where Jesus overthrew the tables and ran the moneychangers out of the temple, to 2nd Chronicles 6 and 7 when Solomon built the temple and dedicated it, the purpose of the temple is explained in depth. This is a real eye-opener on prayer. Just as the religious Pharisees were ineffective and uncaring for the lost, with no real compassion, today many Christians are caught up in worldly things, while their family and friends are lost,  too busy to pray as they should. Jesus said his house should be a house of prayer and we are the temple of God. Are we houses of prayer? Do we pray as we should?"

Paul Washer is giving a presentation of the work of the HeartCry Missionary Society, and his message is an encouragement to believe that God is at work in the world and His gospel is indeed the power of God unto salvation. HeartCry owes its continuity and growth since 1988, not to the great faith of men, but to the great faithfulness of God. “God delights in vindicating the confidence of his children”, Mr Washer asserts, and the more we cut ourselves off from the arm of the flesh, the more we will see of the arm of God. Why does HeartCry prefer to work with indigenous (locally born) missionaries? Why is theological training so vital? Why is it important to establish autonomous local churches? The answers to these and many more question are in this message. If nothing else, listen to it for the moving account of how God provided Christian books for a small church in the jungles of Peru, and believe Mr Washer when he says, “God moves nations for you!  Don't you just love a God like that?”.  (58  minutes)  "

These are all good things but God's call for greatness is higher. If we don’t have the love of God all these things count for nothing. We are called to put away childish things such as grievances, unforgiveness, envy, pride and anger and begin to love others like Jesus loves us. This is impossible to do without the power of the Holy Spirit. Christ in us gives us the power to go beyond human limitations into the supernatural love of God. The indisputable evidence of a great church is the love we have for one another. It is something of God working in us and through us."

When difficulties and trails come you will be tempted to take another course and follow another Jesus. The key to avoid this is to have a deep abiding trust in the faithfulness of God, knowing that His ways are not our ways and He has a divine plan. Take comfort in knowing we are in hands that are much bigger than ours and we will be triumphed over. Jesus Christ promises us we will make it to the other side."

		"description" : "A deeply moving wake-up call to the church, instructing her to live in the light of eternity, \"for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ\" (2 Corinthians 5:10). Leonard Ravenhill describes the judgment day from Scripture as a court day  where the verdict is final. He first points to the judgment of the unjust and then focusses on the judgment of the righteous. He emphasizes that we will all stand before Jesus alone and will not only be judged for what we have done, but also for what we have not done that we should have done. He denounces the worldliness of the people of God who invest their time and money as the world does - thus building on wood, hay and stubble as opposed to silver, gold and precious stones. Leonard Ravenhill strongly opposes today's \"sloppy gospel\" and \"sloppy evangelism\"  of a love with no judgment. He warns that we are passing from the mercy of the lamb to the wrath of the lamb when Jesus judges the earth and mercy will be gone forever. As the work of every human being shall be tried in the fire, many public ministries will go down in ashes. Leonard describes 95 % of believers as bound by superstition and theology. He criticizes the unjust money-making of public ministries that leads to false investments of large amounts of money. He states that we must have Jesus take the government over our lives in reality and be lost and consumed in Him. Ravenhill closes his sermon with a strong call to repentance: \"If we cannot live as a different breed of people on this earth we have no right to live here. God stamp eternity on my eyeballs.\""

Carter points out that a Christians life of self denial involves continuous change and that it is important not to rely on past or present people, places, or things. We go from glory to glory and there is a constant need for change. When Christians refuse to change, they stay in secure places and do things even in worship that that are the way they have always done them. Churches that that once had fire can become dead by not changing. Carter went to Rev 2 with the church of Ephesus as an example of a church without change leaving it's first love for familiarity. Carter used the example of Peter getting out of the boat to walk on water of a person who gets away from the security of familiar circumstances to follow the Lord's bidding. Hebrews 13;14 Was quoted early by Carter, \"We have no continuing city\"."

The message is centered on the verses between Revelation 3:14 to 3:22  Carter also uses verses from Mark chapter 4 to show the disciples fearfulness and lack of concern for others when they were in storm with Jesus in the boat.  The church of Laodicea had the same lack of concern for others with the self-centered life that they were in.  In Isaiah chapter 58, the message speaks of the fast that God has chosen instead of the fasts of pretence that the people of that time were doing.  Like the church of Laodicea, the people of Isaiah’s day were living life for themselves with no concern or grief for the poor or suffering.  With these verses the message went into a parallel with much of the church of today that looks for self-help books, or seminaries, or even counseling without seeking God or God’s word for problems.  Carter encourages married people with problems to look to Ephesians chapter 5 for an answer to problems instead of the counsel of someone who suggests that all your problems are from your third and forth generation.  The message ends with words about revival using the revival of Ezra where it speaks of the people weeping. Revival has a strange mixture of weeping and joy.  In revival the hearts of the people are broken and there is remorse.  The church of Laodicea did not weep for others."

This would be to partake of a supernatural life for the betterment of others. There are so many Christians today that follow Jesus for what they can get from Him. What about you will you refuse the fellowship of Christ for your own gain or will you take the low road and be spent for the cause of Christ?"

We were created for intimacy with a living God. Some people go through their whole life searching to satisfy this need. Today Jesus Christ offers you this intimacy. The Bible says there is a day coming when some will stand before a Holy God only to find they let this intimacy and eternal life slip though their fingers. Sad to say in that moment you will understand how much God loved you. Today is the day of salvation, don't let it slip away."

Jude shows how evil works are the result of apostacy just a James shows that true good works are the result of true faith. Interestingly the name Jude means Judas, which of course is a name synonymous with treachory and apostacy.  From the first few verses we discover that Jude was the brother of James and most likely the brother of Jesus Himself, we also find that he had originally intended to write an encouraging letter but was constrained by the Holy Spirit to exhort his bretheren to contend for the faith.  He had to do this because apostates had crept into the church of Jesus and were denying the foundational doctrines of the Lord."

Cain was a farmer where as Abel was a shepherd, interestingly originally mankind did not eat meat till after the flood and so the sheep were most likely for sacrificial purposes.  Cain thus offered the works of his own hands which told God that His way was not good enough in Cains eyes and this was blasphemy.  Balaam was a prophet who was paid to curse Israel, but the Lord would not allow him to prophecy against His people so Balaam counselled Balak in how to get Israel to sin with the daughters of Moab.  Korah rejected the mediator between God and the people of God who was at the time Moses, this was rejection in type of the Lord Jesus, which came with penalty of Korah and all those who rebelled with him going down into Sheol alive.  From what happened to these three we see the high price of apostacy."

Because this is exactly what Enoch prophesied against, Enoch was given a reveltaion from God that caused him to name his son Methuselah (whose name means 'when he dies judgement shall be sent'), no wonder Enoch walked with God after Methusaleh was born.  And yet Methuselah is a model of the Lord's grace because he is oldest man in the scripture. Interestingly some rabinical sources claim that Methuselah died one week before the flood, just when Noah entered into the Ark, we do know from the scripture that Methuselah died in the same year as the flood.  Enoch confronted the apostates of his day and some signs of apostacy are murmering, just as Israel did at the beginning of Jude, complaining as the angels did, and going after their own lusts just as Sodom and Gomorah did."

By saying they are soulish and natural and that do not have the Spirit, thus they are unsaved and unable to discern the truth of God.  Jude finishes his letter with an exhortation to the believers to build up their faith and ensure they remain kept in the love of God.  Jude exhorts different types of witnessing, with love and with fear, and finishes his epistle with a proclamation as to the keeping power of God, who is not only able to keep us from falling but also able to present us fautless on that final day, praise be to God."

We see the typology associated with the wilderness wanderings, such as Israel's baptism in their corssing the Red Sea, the manna they ate was the bread of life and the Rock they drank from was Christ.  When the people loathed the bread they were attacked by snakes and had to look upon a brass serpent on a cross which Jesus Himself said was type of Him.  Dr Missler also discusses 'Kingdom Now' or 'Dominion' theology which tries to set up the Kingdom of God on earth which of course will not happen until the Lord returns."

Satan who was originally created perfect and was the heighest created being, fell because of his pride and ambition to be worshipped like God and sit in Gods place.  Dr Missler puts forward that demons are not fallen angels as demons seem to require a host body where as angels can appear in their own bodies.  In Genesis 6 the scripture recalls a period in history when the 'sons of God' which in OT times was always translated 'angels' married human women and had monsterous children known as the Nephilim or 'fallen ones'.  He states that this was the sin of the angels that lead to them being imprissoned and probably to the flood in orer to completely destroy the monsterous offspring.  Intersting stuff."

		"description" : "Jude reminds us of the judgement on Sodom and Gomorrah that were destroyed to such a degree that it is believed that the cities used to be built upon the land where the Dead Sea, the lowest point on the earth, now is.  The sin of Sodom was the condoning of such widespread and abominable sin within the cities gates, which was not only homosexuality.  Back in Genesis, Abraham had interceeded for the cities and the Lord had been merciful but the only people to be delivered from the cities was Lot and his family although hid wife of course did not survive due to her emotional ties to the cities.  It is interesting that Jude mentions this incident in a letter about apostacy as this means that Sodom knew the truth and turned from it, becuase the truth is revealed to all of through creation itself.  So these apostates act as they want, deny authority and speak evil of dignities."

From other scriptures we learn that Michael the archangel is almost always associated with the nation of Israel and this leads Dr Missler into the idea that the dispute was to foil the Lord's plan regarding the two witnesses in Revelation 11, as Moses is believed to be one of the witnesses as his ministry was interupted, as was Elijah's, the other witness.  Interestingly even when Michael was on a mission from the Lord doing His will, he doesn't rebuke Satan directly but rebukes him in the name of the Lord.  This is the most extreme example of not being disrespectful to dignities, a sin we we are so often guilty of."

		"description" : "A spiritual Christian is one in which there are many paradoxes. The sentence of death - We do not live by man's wisdom but we live by God's grace. God sees no good in the flesh, and He has sentenced us to death in the Lord Jesus. We have all been crucified with Christ. The problem is that we still think that we can live the Christian lives in our own strength. God has to bring us through many experiences where we discover that what God has said about us is true. That truth is that in me, that is in my flesh, there dwells no good thing. When we accept the sentence of death, then the resurrection of Christ is released and we begin to walk in the newness of life. Another paradox is one of victory and defeat. In our concept, the spiritual man is one that is always in control of his circumstances. However, the truth is that a spiritual man is still a man with feelings, and it seems like at times he will not overcome, but the Lord's lilfe is working in these situations and the result is resurrection. A third paradox is that we have this treasure in earthen vessels. The treasure is our Lord Jesus. He lives in these fragile vessels. God's purpose is that the radiancy of the treasure might be manifested. The earthen vessel must be broken in order for the treasure to be manifested. God's strength is made perfect in our weakness. Paul boasted in his weakness, because in his weakness, he experienced the power of Christ. God has no intention to make us strong, but He will make the power of Christ to be made known in our weakness."

First the dominion of sin is the guilt of sin which is the same as the power of sin, sin has power over us when we feel the guilt that comes with it, and the passage of time does nothing to releave the power of sin over us to make us feel condemned.  Secondly to be under the Law means that we are trying to please God by trying to keep the moral Law which cannot be done thus the law is the power of sin, as we try and keep the law and fail the guilt , or power, of sin increases on us, we thus end up feeling so condemned that we think that bit of extra sin cannot make a bad situation worse.  Thirdly though despite all this we are under grace, not the dominion of sin, neither the law but grace!  The grace of God is shown in that even though we deserve Hell He gives us love and mercy.  Finally to reckon ourselves dead to sin means to realise sin has no more power to condemn us because of the work of the Lord Jesus on the cross of calvary."

Many turn back right at the place where they will begin to discover and enter into the supernatural life of God. When we are in unbelief we begin to limit God by doubting that He could supply what we need and take us where He is calling us to go. The central core of unbelief is that God's way is incomplete and we must help Him bring His plan to pass. If you are sitting in unbelief, remove yourself from that place and grab on to the promises of God. We must learn how to trust God for strength and provision. Don't pray to get out of the situation, pray that you may find supernatural life in it. God is looking for people who have come through the wilderness with a voice of triumph to speak to the next generation. Do you believe that God CAN, or will you limit the Holy One of Israel?"

God's Kingdom is a NOW Kingdom and He beckons us to leave behind what we once trusted in, let go of all our baggage, and slip through the eye of the needle! It's the person who realizes he has nothing to offer God but a willing heart that slips through the Eye of the Needle. The issue is letting go and trusting God."

Though man possesses a natural desire to worship, he wishes to worship any way he feels like worshiping. The God who wants us to worship Him, however, has decreed how we are to do so. Pastor Tozer details three kinds of worship that God outrightly rejects: 1) “Cain worship:” worship without atonement. 2) “Samaritan worship:” accepting what one wants to believe, neglecting what one doesn’t, and adding what’s not there at all. 3) “Nature worship:” mistaking worship of God’s creation for worship of God himself. John 4:24 describes the kind of worship that God gladly accepts. Psalm 45:11 and 2 Thessalonians 1:10 are also texts for this 39-minute sermon."

While trying to reach the lost in the Wall City in Hong Kong, she saw that her approach to sharing Jesus did not work. She was passionate to reach the lost, but she realized she did not have the power to make Jesus known. Her words did not work. This prompted her to seek God and she prayed: \"Dear Lord, please give me whatever it is that helps me make Jesus real to the lost. Because the words don't seem to be working.\" This led to her receiving what is often called the baptism of the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues. She points out that our part as believers is to allow Jesus to reveal Himself to men. She teaches how we must expect and pray that the Spirit of God will meet the spirit of man. God wants us to share spiritual truth with spiritual words (communicating spirit-to-spirit), instead of reasoning with people (communicating mind-to-mind). A final note: The first five minutes of the recording contain a word in tongues with interpretation as well as a prophecy in Chinese that is being translated into English. This may seem unusual if one is not accustomed to the exercise of the gifts of the Spirit. Please let this not keep you from listening on. What follows is a wonderful message on the working of the Holy Spirit that shows that \"evangelism\" really is not our job but God's."

She makes clear that the Holy Spirit lives in every true Christian from his or her new birth on. This inner work of the Holy Spirit grows character and fruit in the believer. Jackie goes on to describe an additional and complementary gift. It is often called the outpouring of the Holy Spirit or the baptism of the Holy Spirit. This experience is accompanied by the evidence of a personal prayer language (speaking in tongues). The outpouring of the Holy Spirit equips the believer with power to share Jesus with the lost. Jackie emphasizes again that we must share spiritual truth with spiritual words (1 Corinthians 2:13). The message starts with several wonderful testimonies of how God revealed Himself to the lost in the Wall City and how drug addicts came off drugs with no medication and no withdrawal symptoms."

While any believer can be used by God anytime to operate in any of the nine spiritual gifts, he or she does not \"own\" any of them. The personal prayer language, however, is a gift of God that the believer can \"take home\" and use anytime."

The devil will try to captivate us and attempt to convince us that the battles we face are bigger than the Christ in us. God will leave these trials in our life to train our hands for war and to cause us to depend on the power of the Holy Spirit. We need to understand our enemies are already defeated but we still need to go to Jesus to get the resources and to stand in faith. If we lose sight of God in these trials we will turn to human reasoning and begin to follow our own sensual nature and desires."

We have entered the Canaan which our Joshua has given unto us; Moses, by the law, could not lead us into this promised land; but Jesus has brought us into it, and we now have our portion and our inheritance in the covenant blessings which God has provided for his people in Christ Jesus his Son. God's people, when they are as they ought to be, are in a state of rest even now.

But our Lord declared that there was no necessity for them to go away from him, even though they were hungry, and famished, and in a desert place. Now, if there was no necessity for hungry hearers to go away, much less will it ever be needful for loving disciples to depart from him. If these, who were hearers only, - and the bulk of them were nothing more, a congregation collected by curiosity, and held together by the charm of his eloquence, and by the renown of his miracles, - if these needed not to depart, much leas need they depart who are his own friends and companions, his chosen and beloved.

At the time when certain of the Jews returned with Nehemiah to Jerusalem, many of them were in very straitened circumstances; and, contrary to the Jewish law, the richer Jews lent them money upon usurious interest, amounting to the hundredth per month, or twelve per cent. per annum. They took from their poorer brethren their lands, or put a heavy mortgage upon them; and in some cases took the men themselves to be slaves for debts which they had unavoidably incurred. Now, as you know, every Jew was a landholder, and his land, if mortgaged for a time, must return free to him in the fiftieth year; and, though a Jew might for a while become a servant to his Jewish brother, yet he must go out free at the end of the seventh year. He could only be bound for a short period of servitude. Nehemiah called to him, therefore, the elders, and nobles, and rulers of Jerusalem, and showed them how wrong they were to hold their poorer brethren in bondage.

Yet he lived to tell the tale of deliverance. His prayer from among the waves was a memory worth preserving, and he does preserve it. The mercy of God to him he weaves into a song for us; and in this our text is found. Two things the rescued sufferer tells us. First, that, as God delivered him from the power of sin, so he will deliver all his praying, wrestling, believing people. That is the last verse of the psalm - He shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.' The argument is - He delivered me. What am I more than others? The gracious Lord who saved me will save all those who call upon him in truth.

The dew of dawn should be consecrated to devotion. The text is a very remarkable expression, and might fitly be made the early-riser's motto. It is, in the original, a highly poetical phrase, and Milton and others have borrowed or imitated it. 'I will awaken the morning.' So early would the psalmist arise for the praise of God, that he would call up the day, and bid the sun arise from the chambers of the east, and proceed upon his journey. 'I will awaken the morning.' Early rising has the example of Old Testament saints to recommend it, and many modern saints having conscientiously practiced it, have been loud in its praise. It is an economy of time, and an assistance to health, and thus it doubly lengthens life. Late rising is too often the token of indolence, and the cause of disorder throughout the whole day. Be assured that the best hours are the first. Our City habits are to be deplored, because by late hours of retirement at night we find early rising difficult if not impossible.

Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee. Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee. Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established. Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.” It is clear that every part of our nature needs to be carefully watched, lest in any way it should become the cause of sin. Any one member or faculty is readily able to defile all the rest, and therefore every part must be guarded with care. We have selected for our meditation the verse which deals with the eye. These windows of light need to be watched in their incomings, lest that which we take into our soul should be darkness rather than light; and they need to be watched in their outgoings, lest the glances of the eye should be full of iniquity, or should suggest foolish thoughts.

When the children of Israel came out of Egypt the Amalekites resisted them and fought against them, and they never put it right. When Saul returned from the victory over the Amalekites, he met Samuel and told him that he had performed the commandment of the Lord. He was blind to his own disobedience. Saul killed off the worthless lifestock and that which was despised, but the good and precious he held back. He also let Agag, the most evil of all the Amalekites live. He dealt friendly with him and made friends with God's enemies. But when Samuel saw the brazenness of Agag, he took the sword himself and hewed him in pieces before God. Samuel showed Saul his folly of befriending evil men."

He will bear fruit and his leaf will stay green, even in drought. We do not know our lives ahead. Difficult times might come, but if we are of this blessed kind, we will continue to bear sweet fruit and prosper. It is a great blessing if this life is your desire, and not on your lips only, but a reality in your life.

It is also marvellous that we do not find a trace of haugtiness in John, when he acknowledges, \"I baptise with water, but there stands one among you, whom you do not know; He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.\""

King Herod, in a moment of intoxication and lust promised his lover's daughter (who had eroticially danced at the wine-flowing party) \"up to half his kingdom\". Her mother, with a deep-seated hatred against John the Baptist seized the opportunity to demand his head on a platter.

It is in these seasons that satan himself will come with roaring accusations and attempt to lead us into a wilderness and a sense of powerlessness. It is complete fiction to believe the devil has any power to take you as a sincere believer from the security of your position through Christ in God. The devil can only come against us with roaring lies but in REALITY he has no power to do this. God Himself will come and whisper His mercy and love to show us we are not alone and evil will not triumph over us. He will vanquish our enemies with a still small voice and comfort and nourish us."

He says that people who preach that it is wrong to marry inter-racially are simply not preaching a biblical ideal and need to repent.

He also points out how the Holy Spirit predicted the scoffing view of evolution through 2Peter 3:3-7. Ham also explains how so many things we believe moralistically come from Genesis 1-11. "

Tozer, in keeping with the historic Christian stance on the theater, condemns the religious movie, giving the following seven reasons: 1. It violates the scriptural law of hearing. 2. The religious movie embodies the mischievous notion that religion is, or can be made, a form of entertainment. 3. The religious movie is a menace to true religion because it embodies acting, a violation of sincerity. 4. They who present the gospel movie owe it to the public to give biblical authority for their act: and this they have not done. 5. God has ordained four methods only by which Truth shall prevail -- and the religious movie is not one of them. 6. The religious movie is out of harmony with the whole spirit of the Scriptures and contrary to the mood of true godliness. 7. I am against the religious movie because of the harmful effect upon everyone associated with it."

		"description" : "“I myself will awake early.” — Psalm 57:8. THE proper subject to treat upon with such a text as this would be the propriety and excellence of early rising, especially when we are desirous of praising or serving God. The dew of dawn should be consecrated to devotion. The text is a very remarkable expression, and might fitly be made the early-riser's motto. It is, in the original, a highly poetical phrase, and Milton and others have borrowed or imitated it. 'I will awaken the morning.' So early would the psalmist arise for the praise of God, that he would call up the day, and bid the sun arise from the chambers of the east, and proceed upon his journey. 'I will awaken the morning.' Early rising has the example of Old Testament saints to recommend it, and many modern saints having conscientiously practiced it, have been loud in its praise. It is an economy of time, and an assistance to health, and thus it doubly lengthens life. Late rising is too often the token of indolence, and the cause of disorder throughout the whole day. Be assured that the best hours are the first. Our City habits are to be deplored, because by late hours of retirement at night we find early rising difficult if not impossible. If we are able to escape the shackels of custom, and secure for devotion and contemplation the hour when the dew is on the grass, we may count ourselves thrice happy..."

God influences choices because He loves and cares for us, but we have the right to not choose God. God will not force His choice upon us, He is an gentleman. In pictures of Christ there is an attempt to define Him in form. It is more God honoring according to the commandment of not making an graven image of God to not make any image of Jesus Christ. Gods will for original man is to be fruitful and multiply and to subdue the earth. All the animals at that point lived off the grasses and vegetation, there was no carnivous animals. God rested meaning that He was not exhausted but that the creation was completed. This chapter gives the first look at creation, but the next chapter gives an more detailed version of the creation of man. And God is revealed in a different name: Jehovah.

The righteousness of God is by faith by resting in Jesus and what He has done for us on the cross. It would be extremely healthy for us one day a week to relax once a week. We keep going all the time we need to stop and just rest one day a week, it would be healthy but wouldnâ€™t make you any more spiritual. JHVH this was the form of Gods name because of Godly reverence. YAWEH is possibly the right vowels. LORD = Elohim, Yahweh (as a name) Lord = Adoni (as a title). The earth was watered by an mist before the flood. There is no way to find out where the garden of Eden was, the whole earths form was changed during the flood and other large natural events. During the time of Pegleg the earth was divided, could that mean the earth started to change and separate? The garden of Eden appears to be somewhere in Babylon which is modern day Araq.  Life would be boring if there was nothing to do therefore God had man working in the garden of Eden to tend and care for it. Really an child of God has a true care for the nature and the world that God has created compared to even an humanist, because their humanism is based ultimately in selfishness. Dying thou shalt surely die. So it was a 2 fold death, a spiritual death and an beginning of an physical death. Where ever the gospel of God goes there is a freedom of choice and in nations and places where the gospel doesnâ€™t exist there is a lose of the freedom of choice and an slavery. To make the power of choice meaningful he had to give the option and choice to disobey. This power of choice makes man something more then a robot. You could never receive meaningful love or devotion from a robot, so for our relationship to God to be meaningful there has to be choice. "

Someone had the interpretation that Even knew the serpent and thatâ€™s how the seed of Cain was formed but that is clearly conjecture and not scriptural fact. In the Old Mosaic law the offering of grain was a plausible offering to be given to God. It was the lack of faith in Cainâ€™s offering. Sometimes the best commentary of the Old Testament is the New Testament. For example in Hebrews 11 it tells us about the situation of Cain and Abel. Just because God questions in genesis doesnâ€™t mean that God doesnâ€™t know but rather he is trying to get Cain to confess. God knows exactly what I happening all the time but God is merciful to try and get us to confess our sins before Him. We always try to justify ourselves rather then just saying, â€œI am wrongâ€. There was much more a purer strain of humans in the beginning therefore marrying a sister would not cause such genetic defects as it would today. Methuselah almost lived for an entire millennium. Noahâ€™s father still lived at the same time that Adam was living. Methuselah died in the year of the flood. Enoch broke the chain, he was a man of faith because he walked with God. He has the testimony in Hebrews that Enoch pleased God. The father says of His son, this is my beloved Son who I am well pleased with. We please God in our trusting Him.

There are many theories surrounding all the facets of the true story of Noah and the great flood that occurred. One states that the valley where Noah lived was  flooded but if that was the fact then God could have simply told him to go over to an mountain ridge nearby or over to another valley. Also Many findings of the different coruscations of the earth and layers that occur over time show what was found on each layer, but interestingly there are trees and other objects that go through many of the layers of even so called â€œmillionsâ€ of years. These inconsistencies really speak against what some scientists call fact. Chuck believes that the Noah story is not a good story to use for the proof of the rapture because God is more merciful then just saving that few.

But we have been given human language so thatâ€™s the way God is conveying Himself to us. Before the fall there was no great violent winds the climate was very moderate. At the beginning of the new civilization after the flood God said that no man should shed the blood of another man. This is the beginning of government and moral law. The way that man has kept the law is unjust but that does not go against the principle that God intuited it. The people who so strongly cry against capital punishment are for abortion, which goes against the scripture and specifically in this chapter how God is laying out moral law. The verse be fruitful and multiply is the admonition to increase and no to kill children such as abortion advocates and therefore is the opposite of Gods call in this verse. Gods covenant with the rainbow means that God will not destroy the entire earth with a flood but that does not mean there will be localized flooding. God will destroy the earth dissolving the elements, fire being the opposite then water. Saw the nakedness of his father (Noah) in the Hebrew actually means he was gazing.

But rather pegleg lived during the tower of Babel and in his day the peoples were divided into different languages and speeches. The original language in the world was possibly Hebrew, because the early names in the genealogies are Hebrew with Hebrew meanings. Babel was rebellion against Gods command to be fruitful and multiply and subdue the earth. It is possible that God could have put the message of the gospel in the heavens but whatever God does the devil always tryâ€™s to pervert and misuse.

When the Church is persecuted that persecution is rooted in the world and the worldly system. Jesus said that as it is in the day of lot then it will be in the days of the Son of man. Peter also shows that lot was delivered and how much more can God deliver the godly in Christ Jesus that follow Him. Hospitality is extremely important in the culture of Abraham, etc. The women did a lot of work in those days towards fixing meals etc. To sit in the gate of a city was a place of honor and Lot was there. Know them = to know them in a sexual lewd manner. For Lot to sacrifice his 2 daughters (their virginity) speaks possibly of the low regard for women.

The enticements for sinning are from the flesh not from God. God can test us but never will he lead us into doing a sin or sending direct temptation. By our own lusts we are drawn away and enticed.

There are a lot of works that are done in the flesh that are going to be consumed; they will be wood, hay, and stubble.

God thinks with a for-knowledge. We cannot think in the same way as God. If we select someone we cannot ever see how the person is going to work out, but God knows the end of men. Therefore God can elect a person he has for-knowledge of so that he can fulfill his purposes. The way that Isaac asks Esau to get a savory meat was a cheap way to get a blessing, and his wife (Rebecca) knowing that Jacob would used of the Lord better then Esau. Isaac blessed Jacob instead of Esau, was it Gods will that Jacob should be blessed? Yes. Why is it that we think that God cannot do His work without us? Such is not the case; God can accomplish his purposes apart from us, and will if necessary. The work of God is never dependent on our deception (i.e. Jacob). If it is a true work of God it will be done, God is able and is not dependent on us especially on money situations.

There shall be a gathering-time for every one of us. It may come to-morrow; it may be deferred another handful of years; it may come to us by the long process of consumption or decline; it may advance with more rapid footsteps, and we may in a moment be gathered to our people. Sooner or later, to use the expressive words of Job, the Almighty shall set his heart upon each of us, and gather unto himself our spirit and our breath. That gathering rests with God! - the prayer of the Psalmist implies it, and many Scriptures affirm it. As Young sings in his Night Thoughts – “An angel's arm can't hurl me to the grave.” Accidents are but God's arrangements; diseases are his decrees; fevers his servants, and plagues his messengers. Our mortality is immortal, till the Eternal wills its death. “Return, ye children of men” can be spoken by none but our heavenly Father, and when he gives the word, return we must without delay..."

Let us cry to God in secret, and in the family, and in all our assemblies, that God would save the sons of men. But prayer, if it is sincere, is always attended with effort.

They carry truth home as an arrow has often been known to carry death to the person aimed at, for they strike, they stick, they penetrate, they wound. Our Lord Jesus very frequently made use of proverbs; nor was he singular in so doing. The prophets of old constantly employed them; and here, in our text, we see Amos, — who, from his occupation as a herdsman and gatherer of sycamore fruit, was probably more familiar with their use than some others of the prophets were, — puts together two proverbs which were commonly used to signify that men do not, as a rule, continue to labor in vain, and spend their strength for nought."

He who is wisest will be the first to confess his own ignorance. Our faith in the superior knowledge of God is a great source of comfort to us. That he knows everything, is a sort of omnipresent covering to our naked ignorance. Though we know not as yet, we rejoice that he knows, and it is better that he should know than that we should know. Knowledge is safer in the hands of God than it would be in our hands. The infinite God alone is to be trusted with infinite knowledge. The first words of our text, “The Lord knoweth,” often come as a comfort to my own mind. The text says, “The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations.” This is only one of the many things, which the Lord knoweth. For instance, sometimes we meet with perplexing doctrines; perhaps we endeavor to effect reconciliation between the predestination of God and the freedom of human action. It is better not to wade too far into those deep waters, lest we lose ourselves in an abyss. “The Lord knoweth.”"

They are always afraid that we shall offend other hearers. Hence, if the truth be spoken in a plain and pointed manner, and seems to come close home to the conscience, they think that surely it ought not to have been spoken, because So-and-so, and So-and-so, and So-and so took offense at it. Truly, my brethren, we are not all slow to answer in this matter. If we never offended, it would be proof positive that we did not preach the gospel.

Ingrid played excerpts of a message by Paul Washer that was preached to 5,000 young people at a Southern Baptist conference. Ingrid pointed out that the message was not well received. Why is that? Today, Christian youth are exposed to many entertainment based Bible messages. This is in direct contrast to Reverend Washer's message. He communicated that far too many people believe that even though they love so many things in the world, they're saved because at some point in their life they prayed a prayer and supposedly \"accepted\" Christ into their life. Reverend Washer debunks this notion of split allegiance. He explains how we need to learn how to love the things that God loves and hate the things that God hates, recognizing that the only reason we are saved, if in fact we are, is because Jesus, on the Cross, took upon himself the wrath of the Father; wrath that would otherwise have fallen on us."

He played a clip demonstrating the passion this preacher preached with. The clip convicted me tremendously, but I also couldn’t help but think of those in the past who have called me “too intense” and “radical.” Is there a sense that many of those who call on the name of Jesus have no idea what true commitment to following Christ entrails? Is seeking “Your Best Life Now,” expanding your territory, or hunting your “Purpose Driven Life” really what it is all about? When Jesus said to cut off your hand or poke out your eye, or to take up your cross and follow Him, was he being “too intense” and “radical?” I don’t think Paul Washer believes so, neither do I. If you have 3 minutes, listen to this! This is Paul Washer speaking at a youth rally. Is this too intense and radical, or is it someone who believes the Lord at His words?"

The tune to which heaven and earth are set, is the same. In heaven they sing, “The Lord be exalted; let his name be magnified for ever.” And the earth singeth the same: “Great art thou in thy works, O Lord! and unto thee be glory.” It would seem, therefore, a strange anomaly if the church, the temple of the living God, should be void of song..."

There were groanings that could not be uttered within his spirit; and hence he calls his prayer roaring — a “roaring all the day long.” Wherever he was, his spirit seemed to be always sighing, sending a full torrent of melancholy groans upwards towards God; a “roaring all the day long.” So far did this groaning proceed, that at last his bodily frame began to show evidences of it. He grew old, and that not merely in the lines of the countenance and the falling in of the cheeks, but his very bones seemed as if they partook of the suffering. He became like an old man before his time. We have heard of some who through severe trouble have had their hair blanched in a single night."

He focuses on the roles of men in particular, both in their families and their local churches, which he shows to be the two hardest places to live out a Biblical manhood. Most problems in those two areas, he says, can be traced back to men not standing on truth and not acting Biblically. Working through specific examples, he shows how the speculations of men actually fight against God, and also shows how such things should be put right. He then focuses in some detail on marriage, using Romans 8:28. Once a man discovers the true purpose of marriage, and learns what it means to love his wife as Christ loves the church, he will find both joy and rest in putting an end to his former speculations about the nature of marriage.

By placing stripes before the animals made them want to conceive. Jacob noticed the countance of Laban that he was not pleased with Jacob. Then Jacob hears from the Lord to tell him to go back to the land of his fathers. Jacob calls his wife to go out to the field from the tent for him to tell them about this so they are not over heard. Jacob left with all he had without telling Laban and went off to mount Gilad, which is about 300 miles away. The best he could do with that type of large size of flocks is 15 miles a day.

When Jacob fled from his brother Esau he left just with the walking stick in his hand, but now when he has returned he had many flocks. In the present he gave to Esau was 500 animals which was just part of what he had. An honest negative confession is worse then a positive dis-honest confession. It is best to be honest when you talk with God, who are you kidding; He knows your heart and everything about you. There is no hiding of anything to God; everything is open and naked before him. Faith is not passive but active. But God wants us to trust in His ability to do His work. Jacob wrestles with an angel and would not give up and surrender, so when the angel saw he would not surrender he crippled Jacob. One of Jacob’s thoughts was that he could always flee; now the Lord through this crippling has taken away this way of his escape in the flesh.

After 7 years of gathering food then the 7 years of famine began. It was not a local famine but rather a large spread famine that affected many areas outside of Egypt. The brothers were commanded by their father to go down to Egypt to get food. They seemed reluctant to go peradventure they run across their brother who they sold into Egypt slave hood, so possibly they had some bad feelings still for doing this. Benjamin replaced his younger brother Joseph so Israel gave more affection to him, so he had that favored position that once was hold by Joseph. So when the brothers went to Egypt Benjamin was kept home for that reason, lest mischief befall on him.

If we go into situations that are not suitable then we are asking to be defiled and brought into sin. Samson carried the gates of the city 20 miles when they tried to ambush them. You can play with fire but ultimately you will be burned. If you think you are getting by with your passions and desires watch out because it will catch up with you. Women were the failing point of Samson he went into the enemies camp to see a women which was wrong and immoral but the anointed of God did not leave him. Delilah was a deceiver and it was obvious to Samson that she was wanting him to be caught by the philistines. Samson is guilty of an comprise which is always dangerous, he should have said it is none of your business. But he slowly gets closer to the truth to finally talking about his hair. There are times when people have made a special commitment to God. And we make our determination we are really going to live our life for God. Then we compromise when we receive an invitation and are not totally honest.. we need to be honest for the reason why. "

This part of the book of Judges goes back to some of the moral decay that goes on during the time of the judges. The moral corruptness that existed with the people of God when they were not fully committed the Lord. Everyone was doing what was right in their own eyes. This is happening in our day in society if it feels right do it. This is a chaotic and anarchy time in Israel where nobody was really following God or the Law of God. Thus it is always a mark of spiritual detoriation when we start to rely on images and idols of God. It does not mean we have forsaken God but rather it is something that shows how our relationship with the living God is waning. The Levite is becoming a professional religionist now for the 10 shekels and a shirt. Paul speaks of the error in the New Testament that godliness is a means of gain. He said this was an evil doctrine and from such depart, Micah feel into this error believing that God would do him good. "

The story of Ruth is an appendix to the book of judges and fits back to into the time of the judges. Though you may look at an overall condition of an nation yet God is working in a very special way. And the book of Ruth gives an insight into this. In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth which is the biblical mode, but the humanistic viewpoint believes that man created God for our own needs. So man establishes his own moral standards this is very dangerous and is something is that is fully opposed to God. It is quite dangerous to fall into that trap because everyone really believes this and is doing it but we need to go against humanism and keep to Gods standard. God created man and established the moral standards for man. God is wanting to work in the lifes that have open hearts and minds towards Him. "

God needed a man that would speak to the people for Him and hear from God. There was really no mans ears that were open to God. Hannah prayed and gave her child to God if she would have a child. God delays his answers so that it is for His glory and that we would learn to pray aright. Most of our prayers are personal requests to God we are usually thinking of ourselves. If we pray according to Gods will then it will be granted. But we are usually thinking of what we want in regards to asking God. Eli the priest was watching Hannah praying and saw her mouth moving but no words so he thought she was drunk. This shows the low spirituality of the high priest that he could not discern that she was in the spirit and prevailing in prayer with God for his child and the petitions she asked. Once she heard from God she was very joyfully she has faith and believed in God what he said to her. An mark of faith is to act that I have it before I even have it, if God has promised it to us. We need to have a joyful attitude. "

Samuel told the people that the Lord treated them right and that God was faithful to Israel through Egypt and coming into the promised land. They were delivered from the hands of their enemies. God was fair and just and so God gives this plea of His faithfulness to the people but they still wanting in their hearts to have a king. And by choosing this they are rejecting God as king and are wanting a human king like all the nations. But still God gives them mercy saying if you have a king you still will have to keep the commandments of God and He will show mercy.

He comes out every day for 40 days to challenge the children of Israel and nobody goes out to the challenge. David was sent to give some food and get word from his brothers about the army and the battle, then he hears Goliaths challenge and has a godly stirring in his heart against this uncircumcised heathen. Goliath is defying the armies of the living God and David went into Saul to ask permission being only a child. David carries around the head of Goliath for 2 whole days even into the presence of King Saul after the slaughter of the giant. Jonathan and David had a deep bond which they had right away.

David said who can stretch out his hand against the anointed of God. Even though the anointing has left Saul; David still had a deep respect for Gods calling and use of King Saul. Some people murmur and complain against pastors and think they can do a better job then the pastor. There needs to be a sense of Gods calling on a pastor and letting him hear from God of what he should be doing. Once a person gets his mind on critism then it grows and grows and becomes a cancer and they become critical in all things. There needs to be a respect for Gods calling on a man in authority. God was still using King Saul and had plans for his life and its awesome to see David recognize that even in the position he was in fleeing from Saul’s unjust attacks on him."

If they could not figure out where the stone fit then they would throw the stone away and this stone was covered with shrubs. They were looking for the chief cornerstone which was that stone they threw away. The stone that was rejected by the builders it the chief cornerstone. What a sobering visual of what the people of Israel did to the messiah. Peter proclaimed this the Sanhedrin and religious leaders. People did not build temples to dwell in but rather they were making the temple to have God to dwell in. An house for God and the common ordinary people were not allowed in the building, they were allowed in the porches but no in the building itself. But in the Christian life we have God dwelling with us in our hearts. What an amazing barrier and view God has opened up through the death and blood of Jesus Christ. "

If you will obey me and follow me then your family will be on the throne and because they did forsake the Lord they were cut out of the land. A lot of times there are warnings that come from the Lord through many ways, but whenever God speaks to you it is important if God took the time to speak to you. God always warns people in areas they are going to be tempted and tested later on in your life. Even if its something that I am confident in but God knows that down the road you will need to be relying on Him in that area. We need to glory in our weaknesses because we are depending on the Lord but rather Satan tries to trip us up in the areas that we feel confident in because we are not fully relying on the Lord in those areas.

When Gabriel came to the Elizabeth and foretold of the child to be born and said that John the Baptist would be in the spirit and power of Elijah. Elijah also did appear in the mount of transfiguration with Jesus. In the revelation there is a speaking of 2 prophets and one will be Elijah showing up before Jesus comes back again.

If we do not have the gift of miracles we have been led in an more excellent way in the teaching of the Word of God and in the spirit of Jesus Christ. Where is the God of Elijah? He is still the same and has not changed. But our way of living has definitely changed and we need to come to the place because the question that needs to be asked where are the Elijah’s of God?

John Bjorlie wrote that he was a \"tidy-looking English gentleman with a bookish side who discovered ways of slipping into and out of countries that others just assumed were 'closed doors.' He was not a big man, and his pleasant, easygoing manner would not have conjured in your mind the picture of the fearless missionary.\"Born in Lancashire, England, Broadbent operated under the auspices of the Plymouth Brethren movement. His book, The Pilgrim Church, first published in 1931. The Pilgrim Church is an alternative history of the church, unrecorded by secular history. It covers the history of many small churches throughout the ages that have attempted to follow the New Testament church pattern, the success of those that followed the pattern laid out by the apostles and the consequences to the churches that fell away from the pattern. He looks broadly at many groups such as the Paulicians, the Bogomils, the Nestorians, the Waldensians, the Anabaptists, the Hutterites, the Methodists, the Russian Mennonites and the Mennonite Brethren. He classified early primitive churches to Anabaptist, and to Moravian Brethren were historical Brethren Movement."

God is calling His people in the secret closet of prayer so we can get a Word from Him. Don't let the Sunday morning blessings fade into the troubles of this day. Encourage yourself in the Lord!"

This is one of the best illustrations of the Lord Jesus Christ-it's not so much a sermon as a verbal portrait painted with love and care of our Lord that every Christian needs to hear. It will change how you deal with others and it will forever change how you see the Lord if you listen with an open and hungry heart. He goes through many Scriptures, so I'd recommend having a pencil and paper on hand.  "

He traveled thousands of miles by horseback across treacherous terrain to preach the gospel to remote Indians. His calling required a rugged man—he even slept outside in the cold without cover—yet he constantly displayed a gentle and meek love for people entirely different from himself. Their benefit ultimately brought about his early death at the age of twenty-nine. Like an invigorating shower, the listener will be rejuvenated by Brainerd's life-giving devotional insights, refreshing clarity of purpose, and heartwarming preaching. This book offers not only a captivating story, but an uplifting buoy for those who are weary, distant, or discouraged. “Brainerd's spirit was on fire for God, on fire for souls. Nothing earthly, worldly, selfish came in to abate in the least the intensity of this all-impelling and all-consuming force and flame.” — Edward M. Bounds, Power Through Prayer.

		"description" : "Though he was orphaned at age fourteen, repeatedly struck with debilitating illnesses, and unfairly expelled from college, Brainerd allowed nothing to deter him from serving God wholeheartedly. He traveled thousands of miles by horseback across treacherous terrain to preach the gospel to remote Indians. His calling required a rugged man—he even slept outside in the cold without cover—yet he constantly displayed a gentle and meek love for people entirely different from himself. Their benefit ultimately brought about his early death at the age of twenty-nine. Like an invigorating shower, the listener will be rejuvenated by Brainerd's life-giving devotional insights, refreshing clarity of purpose, and heartwarming preaching. This book offers not only a captivating story, but an uplifting buoy for those who are weary, distant, or discouraged.  “Brainerd's spirit was on fire for God, on fire for souls. Nothing earthly, worldly, selfish came in to abate in the least the intensity of this all-impelling and all-consuming force and flame.” — Edward M. Bounds, Power Through Prayer. This audiobook is read by Nick Cordileone."

In addition his careful handling of God's Word, he cites pertinent and interesting examples from revivals from the not-so-distant past such as James McGrady in 1800, the American revival of 1858 and the Welsh revival in early 1900's.  He deals with misconceptions of praying only for leaders and not whole congregations, pointing out from Acts how the Holy Spirit fills both individuals and entire congregations.  Guzik appeals to let go of the 'machinery' of men to earnestly seek God in prayer for 'a unique stirring of the Spirit of God' in our day!"

He tackles theological debates on how revival comes, \"Is it just a soverign work of God?\" or \"Is it the right use of appropriate means?\"  Guzik cited a number of fascinating examples from J.

The children of disobedience are lost and have a different spirit than the saved. The lost live according to the ways of this world and according to the Prince of the Power of the Air (Ephesians 2:2). Those who have been born of water only are fleshly (carnal); but those who have been born of the Holy Spirit are spiritual.

(Matthew 1:21) There is a change of heart that accompanies the genuine born again experience in which sin is no longer viewed as a means to gratification or happiness. Sin is seen as the means of death that is the source of all evil, pain, and suffering. Unrepentant sinners are proficient in sin through their own vain imaginations coupled with the various inventions of others. In contrast, the born again understand that they cannot be saved from hell until they are first saved from sin. Sin is not their friend. Satan is not their friend. The world is not their friend. They realize that sin is forgiven when it is repented of and not while persisted in. The purpose of God in saving man was not to abolish the law and allow man to sin with impunity; that would be antinomianism (lawlessness). The purpose was to establish the absolute Lordship of Jesus Christ as we walk in the Spirit in harmony with the personality of God. "

Their meetings were presided over by an elder or pastor who in turn was presided over by a local 'bishop', literally overseer, who would preside over all the church gatherings an example of a bishop would have been Titus who was told by Paul to appoint elders.  Again in this age of the church there was rapid church growth and the gosepl went as far as India Ethiopia and England. But these were times where the church was under great pressure as persecution was rife and suspicion and fear everywhere."

The early church also believed what was written in the new testament writtings and around the year 220AD there arose a need, because of the arising heresies for a collection of writings that was to be authorative above all other christain writings, these writings were detrermined by three factors. 1: It had to have been written by an apostle or someone in direct contact with one of the apostles. 2: It had to have inherent character and worthiness that was in line with accepted scriptures. 3: I must have been widely recognised by the church at large."

Church theology was also influenced by geography for example the church at Alexandria was largely influenced by greek thinking. Some prominent figures were: Clement of Rome who believed in apostolic succession.  Hermas who wrote 'The Shepherd' which was a very popular book of the time.  Polycarp who was a disciple of the apostle John and fiercely confronted heretics, he was martyred.  Justin Martyr was an early apologist and of course was martyred.  Origen who actually mutilated his own body due to fanatacism, although he was a good man his method of interpretting scripture did a lot of damage."

He granted religious freedom to all faiths and became personally involved in church controversiessuch as the Arian controversy, which states that Jesus is not equal to God.

This influx on non-christians into christian circles led to 'true' christians seeking seperation from the church which led to the beginning of monasticism, but this in turn led to a false sense of spirituality, however there were some monastic movements that were very evangelistic. Another 'movement' that arose in the church at this time was the Roman Catholic church, this denomination came about when the bishop of Rome (which was the most powerful and influential city at the time) was declared by the emperor to have more spiritual authority than all other bishops.  Later in 590AD Pope Gregory I was not only the spiritual leader of Rome but also the political leader this came about when the Roman empire fell the pope stepped into the vacuum left. This was when the church of Rome began to gain more and more power."

The concil voted 298 - 2 against Arius and Nicene creed was established, declaring Jesus to be God. In 450AD the council of Chalcedon was held to discuss the human nature of Jesus, this council determined correcvctly that Jesus was both fully God and fully man. Islam arose in the 7th century and within 100 years of Muhammad's death Islam streched across much of what was the roman empire, the christian empire had been split in 2 by this time with 2 centre, Rome and Constantinople, eventually Constantinople fell to Islam.

In 1492 King Ferdinand of Spain established the spanish inquisition, one of the first things the inquisition did was to expel all jews and muslims out of Spain thus meaning everyone left was 'christian' and therefore under their jurisdiction. The popes by now also reigned as emperors but were corrupt an immoral, more interested in political power and wealth than spirituality, an example of this was that people could pay to be made bishops and cardinals.

Peter Waldo in France paid a priest to translate the latin Bible into french so he could read it easier, this revolutionised his life as he finally could understand what the Bible was saying, because of this though reading of the Bible was outlawed for all non-clergy.

In 1510 he went to Rome, as he was disillusioned with the way the church was in Germany, there he became even more concerned and left declaring that the city was built over Hell itself! He returned to Germany where he became a Bible teacher it was here in preparing for a lesson one day that he read Psalm 31:1 and later Romans 1:17 and realised by faith man can not only be deemed 'not guilty' but actually be seen as righteous before a perfect God."

Because of this coubts crept into Luthers mmind, not about what he found in the scriptures but about the pope and the doctrine that were coming out of the church.  In 1521 a council was assembled called 'The Diet of Worms' it was presided over by Emperor Charles V and gave Luther the opertunity to recant what he had written, he didn't.  Luther was released but the Emperor decreed that anyone who helped Luther from then on would be excomunicated, when he returned to Germany he translated the Bible into German, a version which is still used today, a german KJV if you will.

Philosophical challenges arose in the enlightenment, which was very man centred, people began to ask how man could improve the world and rationalism became popular and placed mans powers of reason above the Bible.  In this time there was also the rise of scientism, secularism and also theological liberalism which is almost now dead in it's original form as it substitutes feelings for truth.  There were also great social reforms the abolition of slavery, prohibtion and womens rights, the missionary movement really took off in the 19th century as transportation was revolutionised and this lead to the idea that the 20th century would be known as the 'christain century'."

It's always been Satan's desire to either have man withdraw his hand from being extended on God's behalf, or to distort the image of God's hand as He is revealed through man's hand. For those of us whose hands have been bitten by the very people God has sent us to help, God is saying DONT GIVE UP. God is calling us to a militant forgiveness so that God's hands will be extended through our hands to reach a fallen world. The weakness in our hands will be strengthened by the resurrected Hands of Jesus Christ."

In a historical sense the events in Esther took place between Ezra chapter 6 & 7.  It starts with king Xeres of Persia in his winter palace preparing for a huge 180 day long feast just prior to him going to war with the Greek empire. During the feat the king commands that the queen be brought beofre him and all his naoble men who are there, the queen however refuses to come for reasons which are unknown, this angers the king greatly as it sets a very bad example to his lords and also to everyone in the empire, so the king decides to find a replacement for the her.  After a search is conducted he choses Esther, a jewess who was the neice of Mordecai one of the kings lords, and a descendant of Kish, king Sauls father.  Mordecai discoveres a plot to kill the king and informs Esther the queen who tells king and the conspirators were killed probably by impaling, but Mordecai received no reward.. yet."

Haman was promted to be the 'prime minister' of the Persian empire and this everyone had to pay ho9mage to him, which they did, all except Mordecai and Haman was greatly angered by this and sought revenge, not just against Mordecai but against his people, the Jews.  Haman went to the king and lies and asks that all the jews be killed in a holocaust fashion, the king doesn't check the facts but agrees and a decree is sent through all the empire.  Mordecai is greatly troubled by this and mourns and tells his niece Esther, the queen, that she has come to her place of status for sucha time as this."

The king shows her mercy and asks what her request is, she asks that she would prepare 2 banquets for the king and Haman.  This was a great honour for Haman, who is overjoyed by it, so they have their banquet and the king asks again what Esthers request is, but again she bides her time.  Haman on his way home sees Mordecai still mouring and is greatly angered that he still does not honour him.  That night the king is unable to sleep and asks for the chronicles to be read to him, in this he discovers that Mordecai has saved his life and not been rewarded yet.  So the king asks Haman what should be done to the man whom the king wishes to honour, Haman thi nking the king means him advises him how and the king commands that Haman honour Mordecai!!  If this wasn't enough for Haman the day after Esther exposes his plot to the king to kill her and all the jews the king flies of into a rage and demands Haman be killed on the very instrument of execution that he had prepared for Mordecai. A problem still remained however the empire had declared that all jews should be killed on a certain day and that day was looming."

Mordecai was made prime minister of the whole empire and so was given the task of resolving the issue by the king.  He set about this by creating new laws that would protect the jews on the day they were set to be massacred.  So when the day finally came that all the jews should be killed they fought for their lives and were helkped by the authorities.  At this time approximately 76 thousand people were put to death throughout the whole empire spanning from India to north Africa but the jews did not take any of the spoil from their enemies.  At this time Hamans 10 sons were also put to death and their bodies hung up in order to disgrace them, this finally meant the end the Amalekites, whom king Saul had disobediently spared hundreds of years prior."

		"description" : "The name Esther means 'something hidden', Martin Luther argues that the book should be removed from the canon of scripture and one of his main reasons was that the book doesn't even mention the name of the Lord, but Luther was wrong because Esther does mention the name of God it's just encoded in the text.  The Bible is full of different codes from equadistant letter sequences to macrocodes, the Word of God has depth which can never be fathomed, the interesting point about some of the codes is that encoded words are always found in passages where the plain text bears some relevence to the encoded word, a phenomenon which is unique to the Bible.  The Hebrew name for Jesus, Y'shua is found in the Old testament over 5,500 times including all major messianic prophecies and even to the extent in Isaiah 53 encoded in the text is 'Yshua is my name'.  Incredible!  Another interesting point is the title Pilate wrote and placed on the cross above the Lord 'Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews' where in Hebrew the first letter of each word spells 'YHWH' the unutterable name of God that He revealed to Moses.  Definitiely a message for anyone interested in Bible codes."

		"description" : "Macrocodes are hidden codes within a body of information that are encrypted within over a wide section of the information, within the Word of God they are better known as types.  Dr Missler puts forward the argument that the book of Esther is not only a facinating and dramatic narrative but is also as story of our own redemption.  The book starts with the king (who represents our soulish nature) and his fall and seperation from the queen (the spiritual side), but the king searches out a another queen and is united with her, unknown to him though is that the new queen Esther is a child of adoption to Mordecai the Jew (who represents the Spirit of God).  Haman and his sons represent the flesh and the works of the flesh respectively, interestingly the meanings of each of Hamans sons names is a different attribute of the fallen nature of man, whether indepence or self righeousness etc.  Using the types that Dr Missler puts forward we have to ask who rules within us, is it Haman (the flesh) or Mordecai (the Spirit).  Interestingly the king is unaware of Haman's true intent until he is exposed by the Esther, Haman is deposed and later put to death, as the flesh must be as the flesh can perform many 'godly' works but will never surrender as long as we are this side of eternity, and Mordecai given rule of the empire.  Who rules in our hearts?"

The 'core' sin of Israel was idolatry, but it was not their only sin far from it.  The Lord chose Hosea's marriage to illustrate how He felt toward Israel, His adulterous wife. the Lord commanded hosea to marry a woman of whoredom and shows Hosea before hand what she will be like toward him.  Each of their childen God then names, again as an illustration of how He felt toward Israel ie the children were the result of a relationship where the husband loved the wife but the wife went away to other men. The first was named Jezreel, which is a place in Israel where there has been great bloodshed and will one day be the location of the final war battle Armageddon. Hosea's other children children showed how the Lord for a time would judge Israel and not show mercy to them for they were no longer considered his people, hence they were called Lo-ruhammah (no mercy) and Lo-ammi (not My people)."

This is reflected in Hosea's adulterous wife Gomer and his faithfulness and love towards, the Lord had blessed Israel greatly and they had turned and praised idols for their blessings, so the Lord promises to send judgement on Israel in order to turn them back to Hi, and that is exactly where Israel are today mostly away from the Lord. Chapter 3 of Hosea has been described by some as the greatest chapter in the whole Bible quite a feat for 5 verses.  Gomer is up for auction as a slave and Hosea buys her back with all he has, he then takes her home and reclothes her.  This is exactly what the Lord has done for us, where we are obviously in the place of Gomer and Hosea in the place of the Lord."

Chapter 5 deals with the punishment for their crimes Hosea prophesied the Israel would fall and later on Judah would fall too, this is exactly what happened even though Judah were given 100 years longer than Israel.  The Lord passed judgement on Israel.  The final verse in chapter 5 is of particular note as it refers to Christs first coming as it mentions the Lord going and the returning (to Heaven) and returning again until Israel acknowledges their sin of rejecting their Messiah and then He will return to them."

There will be a time of great tribulation for the nation of Israel that will culminate in the second advent of the Lord Jesus.  The rest of the chapter gets back into the teritory of God's charges against Israel, these include exploitation, injustice and the most abominable sexual sins, it is again more evidence of adulterous attitude of Israel toward the Lord, but also shows how we are toward Him aswell in running after our 'idols'."

Israel in Hosea time, like our society today, believed that right and wrong were relative concepts thatcould be correct for one person but not necessarily for another, this is of course is utterly wrong God is absolute and He defines right and wrong.  Several of the kings of Israel were assasinated and hence surrounding the ruler there were many men with blood on their hands, Israel had put it's faith in the neighbouring nations and not in the Lord.  Because they had cast god away He would cast them away.  They had replaced the service of God with a dead religion and so thought they could atone for their own sins and because of this God would not even accept their sacrifices to Him."

But now Israel was almost as abominable as in those days.  Verse 11 of chapter 9 is one of the many 'Pro-life' verses of the Bible stating plainly that life begins at conception. Hosea predicts that Israel would be scattered among the nations until the Lord regathered them into the land as only He could do this.

The prophet began to discover that at the very heart of the almighty Creator was love and that God is love.  The Lord shows how His heart was torn for His people as He did not want to judge them but His holiness demanded it.  So judgement had to be prescribed upon the nation as they had commited idolatry in Bethel (the house of God) and this was a forshadowing of the abomination of desolation. We know that ultimately the Lord's love and justice met when His wrath was poured upon our Lord Jesus on the cross of Calvary.  How only His precious blood could atone for the wrong of not just Israel but for all of us."

The Lord reminded Israel that He had brought them out of Egypt and out of bondage, and from this reminded them that He alone was their Saviour.  He shows them that He is their only Hope but they have stubbornly rejected Him and so their Saviour would be their Judge. Hosea beseeches the people to return to the Lord and repent. The Lord states that He will restore them to Him after they have repented, and the Lord would wonderfully take them back to Himself.  The prophecy of Hosea finishes with the ultimate repentence of Israel and turning back to the Lord and the Lord's acceptance of them which will herald the Second Coming."

The gospel message is more than theory or a package to deliver and be gone. Elisha shows us that tears are needed to minister to the souls of men. He is one of many examples of faithful servants of God whose hearts were broken with the urgency to reach perishing souls. In this sermon, a number of Biblical examples are given starting with Elisha. The need for this brokenness is vindicated in the fulfillment of Elisha's prophecy regarding Hazael's reign of terror against Israel. Reasons are also given why God demands brokenness from His servants to deliver His message of grace to deliver souls. The missing element in the modern day evangelical church shows how the church can move from a ministry of power to mere trite conformity to creeds and formalism. This needs to be repented of."

The modernism that has sucked the gospel life out of so many schools and churches was contested by Dr. T.T. Shields of Toronto. His ministry is compared with the legacy of compromise left by Dr. Billy Graham and his evangelistic organisation. Canadian evangelicalism labours under that compromise to this day. This compromise has produced an anemic, sickly consumer based Christianity that is willing to sell out the gospel for man made success."

Instead, he was the pied piper who led them to their destruction. In this message you will learn that the existentialism of Neo-Orthodoxy has led to a play-dough religion. While orthodoxy stands rock solid on the truth that is timeless, New Evangelicals have fallen headlong into the sinking sands of subjectivism. Learn how Barthianism ruined so many denominations and promising evangelicals. Learn why Canada's voice for Orthodoxy has been all but silenced. Again we ask, Where are the preachers? This message will tell us why."

Hannah is greived because she is barren, a situation which was possibly the worst place a woman could be in the Old Testament.  Every year Elkanah and his two wives would go up to Shiloh to the feast and Peninnah would mock Hannah becasue she had not children and Peninnah did.  This caused incredible sorrow in the heart of Hannah, but she did the right thing and poured out her grief before the Lord.  She made a vow to the Lord that if He would give her a son she would dedicate him to the Lord in a deeper and stronger way be seperating him as a Nazerite to the Lord, the remarkable moment came when after she had grieved before the Lord her sorrow left her and her faith in God was restored, did she concieve that moment? no, but God's word was just as sure and she praised Him for it. The Lord opened her womb and she gave birth to one of the most remarkable men in the Bible, Samuel."

She exalts the King, the Anointed One, the Messiah and was the first person to proclaim the God would be the Messiah a theme that was later shwon through all the prophets but Hannah saw it first.  There isw a shift in this passage though in the form of the corrupt sons of the high priest Eli, who didn't know the Lord and by their actions were causing the people of God to hate offering to God as the people knew that the priesthood was so corrupt.  Samuel however served the Lord as a small child and was dressed in priests clothes that his mother would make for him and bring to Shiloh every year, and the Lord further blessed her with 3 more sons and 2 daughters."

On day a man sent from God came to the house of Eli and confronted him about his sons behaviour because God held him responsible for what his sons were doing, the man of God gave Eli, and his sons and invitation to repent before judgement came but they didn't thus judgement had to come in the deaths of Eli's sons adn the removal of Eli's family from the preisthood in the days of Zadok about 70 years later.

King saul in the meentime is plotting against David and accusing all his military commanders of being against him, one steps forward, Doeg the Edomite and informs Saul that he saw David being helped by Ahimelech the priest, Sauls is furiuos and goes to Ahuimelech and accueses him of aiding the enemies of the king, Ahimelech had no idea that David was on the run from Saul due to Davids lies, but Saul didn't care and commanded all the priests and their families to be slaughtered, Sauls servants wouldn't do it but Doeg would and massacred a great number of people, when David heard of this he mourned and wrote Psalm 52."

A few years after Absalom went to Hebron where he decalred himself to be the new king of Israel, when David heard about this he did not defend his throne but was happy to let the things of this world go.  But he had to flee because he knew Absalom would be intent on killing him.

Amazingly though Absaom asked for a second oppinion from Hushai the Archite, he appealed to Absalom's vanity and advised him to amass a great army and lead them out to battle, thus buying the king time, Absalom agreed with Hushai's plan and Ahithophel knowing it would lead to ruin returned home and hanged himself as he knew David would succeed and come after him."

It was highly likely that the famine and the war would not have touched David directly so he chose the punishment of the plague.  Famine and war would also have meant that he would have to rely on man for help but he chose to fall into the hands of the Lord as His mercy is great.  In the plague which lasted 3 days 70,000 people died but thatnks to the mercy of God the plague was stopped when the Angel of the Lord was at the threshing floor of  Araunah the Jebusite.

The young men of Israle were given new names, each to do with a Babylonian god, a good education and meat from the kings table, this last thing daniel politely refused as eating such things would have made him spiritually impure.  The refusal to eat the food offered could have carried with it a death sentence but Daniel took the responsability upon himself so as not to endanger the chief eunuch, Daniel and his companions gave themselves to the Lord in a remarkable way and the Lord blessed them in return in a remarkable way."

When the captain of the guard arrives at Daniels house, Daniel bravely asks for time to seek the God of Heaven in order to tell the king what he desires to know, the king gives him time and the Lord gives Daniel the answer, so Daniel reveals the dream and interpretation to the king.

They faced tremendous pressure when brought before the king himself and asked if the allegations of their 'betrayel' were true, they stuck to their ground and told him they wouldn't bow and that God could deliver them even out of Nebuchadnezzars hand.  For this they were cast into the firey furnace, here the original text implies that they began to sing and praise the Lord and Nebuchadnezzar saw the Lord Jesus with them in the midst of the fiery trial, there is nothing in the text to shwo that they saw the Lord there, but He was there and the trial only served to release them from their bondage."

In his dream he sees a great tree that provides everything that the world needs, he then sees an angelic being saying 'cut it down'. Everyone knew what this dream meant yet only Daniel probably with a heavy heart and tears in his eyes would tell the king, Daniel implured him to repent yet even through this he didn't and thus fell mightily he probably went mad and for seven years ate grass like an ox.

For this Daniel was condemned to be cast into the den of lions, the night he was in the den Darius neither slept nor ate, Daniel prayed as it was his custom to pray 3 times a day.

The third beast is a four winged leopard which shows speed this beast depicts the greek empire under Alexander the great that conquered most of the known world in just 12 years, the beast also has 4 heads and Alexander divided his kingdom between his 4 generals.  The forth beast is different to all other beasts and represents the roman empire, however this beast hasn't been completely destroyed and is still around in the form of the European Union from which David Guzik believes the anitchrist (little horn in this chapter) will arise.

The cultural influence of the greek empire was massive though, and still greatly influences modern thought even more than 2000 years later.

In the prophetic vision that is revealed to Daniel the king of the north is the king of Syria and the king of the south the king of Egypt, historically these 2 kings were 2 of Alexander the greats generals which have been mentioned before, and Israel was caught inbetween their disputes, this was just before the reign of Antiochus, the antichristn of the Old Testament."

They share numerous, numerous testimonies of changed lives, long term effects of the revival, and what it was that God birthed in their hearts in prayer and preparation for it.

The spirit of apathy could, according to a leading scholar, be the very thing that brings our society and that the epitaph of our society will be \"This society died because it just couldn't be bothered\". This spirit is seeping into the church and we see the contrast between it and that man of God the Apostle Paul. He shows how we will not be able to win souls until we have wept for souls and our own apathy has been nailed to the Cross.\r\n\r\n[i]All material by Pastor Legge is copyrighted.

Solomon said in Ecclesiastes chapter 3 and verse 4: 'There is a time to weep, and there is a time to laugh; there is a time to mourn, and there is a time to dance'. In some quarters of the church there is a great emphasis today on laughing and on dancing. Today it seems that the church, God's people, sleep instead of weep. They are merry instead of mourning. I do not believe that the church today, especially in the West, is living in a day of laughter and in a day of rejoicing. They might feel themselves to be, they might have been spellbound like those in Galatians chapter 3, where Paul could say to them: 'Who hath bewitched you', who has cast this spell, hypnotised you into believing something as it is not? I believe that, for the child of God today, our day should be a day of weeping and a day of mourning. I believe that it is a time to cry.\r\n\r\n[i]All material by Pastor Legge is copyrighted.

The good man, the prophet, the teacher. The name \"Jesus\" will hold them all together. As a result, people will think the One World Church cannot be so bad since they focus on Jesus. It is another Christ that some preach, but there is only one resurrected Jesus. The crucial question is: \"Is Jesus Christ the only name under Heaven by which man can be saved?\" The moment we compromise on the exclusiveness of Jesus Christ, the Spirit of God departs. We have no more reason of being here. Make up your mind today whether you will stand or compromise when persecution comes."

As Jeremiah says, it is “Thus saith THE LORD” - not men - regarding what is essential in life; and what is essential is to know and to understand God. It is what we were created for. This is not a question of holding sound doctrine and orthodox truth. I want more than truth, he pleads; I want the REALITY of those truths in my life; deeply rooted, and springing forth into fruit unto the glory of God. This issue is not about doctrine, it is about the person of God; and in order to grow in sanctification, in zeal, in heart-felt emotion and love, we MUST have this personal knowledge of God; it is the source and motivation for all these things. The purpose of all truth is to bring us to the feet of Christ; and from there to the feet of everyone else, as servants; our boasting will then be not in what we know, but rather in what God is.

Some seemed to shrink back from the assertion that God will only allow into His eternal rest those who He found pleasing to Himself.  This message speaks of the biblical aspect of personal responsibility to search out, receive wisdom, and walk worthy of the calling we have received.  There seems to be a voice out there that raises the question, \" but isn't there a place in heaven for the less than full hearted?\"  It seems that some have forgotten the \"evil\" of willful neglect, and humanized the love of God down to the degraded level of a loving grandpa who although might be disappointed with our lack of progress, never really had any intention of rejecting any of those who made some kind of attempt to do what is right.  It frightens me when I consider the stark reality that awaits countless multitudes who will awake to an eternal separation from God and see their self deluded dream of heaven vanish into the flaming judgment of Hell.  They will be shocked that their self created fantasy of what an acceptable walk with God so utterly deceived themselves."

Few people know, with real, unshakeable certainty, that everything is working together for good. If you don’t believe it, you probably have the wrong definition of good. Are you discontented? Are you shaken by adversities, or the removal of blessings and comforts? Mr Washer uses these verses to reveal the causes and the remedy. God has made us sons and daughters, a high calling indeed; yet whilst we certainly benefit, the prime beneficiary is God’s son. God is making brothers and sisters for his son, a fellowship of those who stand in awe of their elder brother and worship him; and we can only worship him truly if we are conformed to his image. We have to be made like him to know how worthy he is; and the more we know him, the more we will be drawn to worship him. Is God’s ultimate purpose your purpose? Is your eye single in this respect? If not, Mr Washer explains what you should do.  (29 minutes)"

The breakdown of public morals and the break-up of the traditional home are well-documented. It is no longer that America merely needs revival. She must experience it! The question is: “Is it too late?” Are we desperate enough to hold on to God and plead, “Wilt thou not revive us again?” Are we impatient or importunate? Do we wish for revival or do we will it? The hour is late, but God's mercy is great!"

When we become familiar with the presence of God we develop a \"we don't need the Holy Spirit because we have everything all figured out\" type attitude. When we do this, we are separating ourselves from the Spirit of God and we are operating with our natural senses. God's spirit will not strive with man and He will not share His glory with anyone. We must watch for and maintain a determination in our hearts that all that we do is for the glory of God and for the testimony of His power."

Brother Zac points out in this sermon how salvation is completely free, but there are things in Christianity that will cost us.  Can you be so lost in ministry that you lose a meal? Suffer persecution?  While emphasizing that we must be victorious in these areas we are encouraged to accept the concept of steady progress over these sins as is shown to be a thematic of New Covenant faith.  "

God dwells with ordinary people who concern themselves with the depth of the need and give all they have for the cause of Christ. The Tabernacle of David is a people who posses the heart of God and then take His heart to a fallen humanity."

The Cross is the power of God in Christ to overpower all the forces of darkness. Because of the Cross the impossible becomes possible. So how do we embrace the power of the Cross? The answer is simple. You can stare at the Cross in unbelief or you can put out your hand by faith and take the victory. We cannot have sin in our life and have the power of the Cross. You have to choose to walk out of sin and walk into the power of God!"

We are all resistant to change especially when it involves what we perceive to be hardship or loss to ourselves or someone we love. There is nothing in us that wants to gravitate toward difficulty. In the western world we have formed a Christian theological perspective that avoids difficulty, which results in an anemic Christianity. When we get a word from the Lord that sometimes doesn't make sense to the natural mind, we must be careful to who and what we listen to. There are well meaning people all along our journey that will unknowingly try to break your heart of obedience. God call us to a radical obedience where we will go where you lead us no matter what the cost! When we learn to walk in the ways of God and follow the voice of God the miraculous is released in our lives. Are you willing to respond to the Lord with, “here I am Lord, send me”?"

A stubborn person has an inner flaw and this inner flaw doesn't show until they are called to put all they are in the hands of God and walk in obedience. A stubborn person can appear humble, zealous and even excercise spiritual gifts, but there comes a certain point they can't get passed. They can't lay down their inner thoughts of the way things should be done and surrender to God's ways. God will allow a sense of emptiness come into our souls to get our attention. He is looking for a sincere heart to submit to the authority of His Word. When we choose to obey Him the power of sin and decay is cancelled in our lives. The only way out of stubbornness is to HUMBLE ourselves before God."

Start thinking of how we can bless others.

The people of Israel had pushed God away so much that He would no longer warn them of their errors and He acctually departed from them in order to leave them their own devices.

Even though they continued to sacrifice to the Lord the Lord no longer accepted the sacrifices as they were given from an unrepentant heart. The southern nation of Judah now tursted in their fortified cities but these cities could not save them from the judgement of God.

The Lord makes great promises of deliverence to Israel even going so far as to say He will conquer death but if they would not turn to Him then they would go into exhile.

If you don’t live after the Spirit, you are still under condemnation.

This life of trials and tests is to form Christ in us – which makes us ready to judge and rule with Him. He segues into the purpose of the blood of Christ: it forgives our sins, it cleanses sin, it covers us (for protection), it nourishes the inner man, it deadens the power of sin over you, and it will literally remove the sin from you (at His coming).

BABBLING fame ever loves to talk of one man or another. Some there be whose glory it trumpets forth, and whose honor it extols above the heavens. Some are her favorites, and their names are carved on marble, and heard in every land, and every clime. Fame is not an impartial judge; she has her favorites. Some men she extols, exalts, and almost deifies; others, whose virtues are far greater, and whose characters are more deserving of commendation, she passes by unheeded, and puts the finger of silence on her lips. You will generally find that those persons beloved by fame are men made of brass or iron, and cast in a rough mould. Fame caresseth Ceasar, because he ruled the earth with a rod of iron. Fame loves Luther, because he boldly and manfully defied the Pope of Rome, and with knit brow dared laugh at the thunders of the Vatican. Fame admires Knox; for he was stern, and proved himself the bravest of the brave. Generally, you will find her choosing out the men of fire and mettle, who stood before their fellow-creatures fearless of them, men who were made of courage; who were consolidated lumps of fearlessness, and never knew what timidity might be."

THE Book of the Lamentations of Jeremiah is very dolorous. When you look upon the dragons, and owls, and pelicans, and bitterns of the wilderness, you have a fit picture of his mournful state. He was full of grief, like a bottle wanting vent. His heart was ready to burst with wormwood and with gall. But the whole current changes when the prophet brings to his remembrance the mercy of God. No sooner does he think of the compassions of the Most High than at once he takes his harp from the willows, and begins to sing as joyously as ever that sweet singer of Israel, David, sang before him; and, truly, if we, too, instead of harping upon our miseries, would but reflect upon our mercies, we should exchange, our mournful dirges for songs of joy. It is true that, God's people are a tried people, but it is equally true that God's grace is equal to their trials. It is quite true that through much tribulation they enter the kingdom; but then they do enter, and the thought of the kingdom that is coming sustains them in their present tribulation. They wade through the waters of woe, often breast-deep; but the billows do not, and shall not, go over them, they shall still be able to sing even in the midst of the tempest."

IF you will read the context of this passage, you will find that these words occur in one of Paul's digressions, or parentheses. He was a writer who very frequently went off at a tangent; he often left the subject on which he was writing, turned his thoughts in quite another direction, and then came back, and went on with the subject which he had left for a while. In this respect, I have; often, in my own mind, likened the apostle Paul to Samson. When he was on the road to Timnath with his father and mother he turned aside to slay the lion, and afterwards to find the honey in the carcass, and each time he came back to his parents just as if nothing had happened. So the apostle Paul often turns aside from some grand argument upon which he is engaged, and says something very valuable and important upon quite another topic, and then comes back again, and calmly and deliberately goes on with his argument."

Balaam, with all his moral shortsightedness, could say, “Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his.” That is the case when death comes in peaceful fashion.

The people of Jerusalem, therefore, had seen their king in most mournful array, wearing the garments of sorrow, and the weeds of mourning; they were, however, cheered by the promise that there should be so complete a defeat to Sennacherib, that the king should again adorn himself with the robes of state, and appear with a smiling countenance in all the beauty of joy. Moreover, through the invasion of Sennacherib, the people had not been able to travel; they had been cooped up within the walls of Jerusalem like prisoners. No journeys had been made, either in the direction of Dan or Beersheba, even the nearest villages could not be reached; but the promise is given, that so completely should the country be rid of the enemy, that wayfarers should be able to see the whole of their territory, even that part of the land which was very far off..."

THIS text is part of a terrible description of God's judgment upon Babylon and Chaldea. The prophet had clearly written out the indictment of the Lord against that tyrannic people, and having proved their guilt he pronounces their sentence. He accused them of shewing no mercy to the inheritance of the Lord which, in his wrath, he had given into their hands. He charges them with pride and boastfulness, for Chaldea had said in her heart, “I am, and there is none beside me;” and Babylon had boasted, “I shall be a lady for ever; I shall see no sorrow.” He testifies against their over-boldness and presumption; for they were given to pleasures and lived carelessly, expecting no ill. Thus said the prophet, speaking in the name of the Lord, “Thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou hast said in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me.” On account of these iniquities the destruction of Chaldea and Babylon was to be sudden, terrible, and complete. They were to be so utterly destroyed..."

I DO not propose this morning to explain again the mystery of the brazen serpent. As many of you well remember, not long ago I preached upon that subject, and endeavored to expound it in all its lengths and breadths. I have a somewhat similar object at the present time, the details may indeed be different, but after all the moral will be the same. Man has very many wants, and he should be grateful whenever the least of them is supplied. But he has one want which overtops every other: it is the want of bread. Give him raiment, house him well, decorate and adorn him, yet if you give him not bread, his body faints, he dies of hunger. Hence it is that while the earth when it is tilled is made to bring forth many things that minister unto the comfort and luxury of men, yet man is wise enough to understand that since bread is his chief want, he must be most careful concerning corn. He therefore sows broad acres with it, and he cultivates more of this, which is the grandest necessary, than he doth of anything else in his husbandry. I feel that this is the only excuse I can offer you for coming back again constantly..."

IT is a very happy circumstance when the servants of God are able to turn everything to account in their ministry. Now, the apostle Peter was summoned before the priests and Sadducees, the chief of his nation, to answer for having restored a man who was lame from his mother's womb. Whilst accounting for this case of cure, or, if I may use the expression, for this case of temporal salvation, the apostle Peter had this thought suggested to him, “While I am accounting for the salvation of this man from lameness, I have now a fine opportunity of showing to these people, who otherwise will not listen to us, the way of the salvation of the soul.” So he proceeds from the less to the greater, from the healing of a man's limb to the healing of a man's spirit; and having informed them once that it was through the name of Jesus Christ that the impotent man had been made whole, he now announces that salvation, — the great salvation, must be wrought by the selfsame means; “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.” What a great word that word “salvation” is!..."

ORIGINALLY, I have no doubt, these words referred to David... However, in this sermon we shall not speak of David, but of the Lord Jesus Christ, for David, as referred to in the text, is an eminent type of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, who was chosen out of the people; and of whom his Father can say “I have exalted one chosen out of the people.” Before I enter into the illustration of this truth I wish to make one statement, so that all objections may be avoided as to the doctrine of my sermon. Our Savior Jesus Christ, I say, was chosen out of the people; but this merely respects his manhood. As “very God of very God” he was not chosen out of the people, for there was none save him. He was his Father’s only-begotten Son, “begotten of the Father before all worlds.” He was God’s fellow, co-equal, and co-eternal; consequently when we speak of Jesus as being chosen out of the people, we must speak of him as a man. We are, I conceive, too forgetful of the real manhood of our Redeemer, for a man he was to all intents and purposes, and I love to sing, “A Man there was, a real Man Who once on Calvary died.” He was not man and God amalgamated — the two natures suffered no confusion — he was very God, without the diminution of his essence or attributes..."

IT is a very great fault in any ministry if the doctrine of justification by faith alone be not most clearly taught. I will go further, and add, that it is not only a great fault, but a fatal one; for souls will never find their way to heaven by a ministry that is indistinct upon the most fundamental of gospel truths. We are justified by faith, and not by the works of the law. The merit by which a soul enters heaven is not its own; it is the merit of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. I am quite sure that you will all hold me guiltless of ever having spoken about this great doctrine in any other than unmistakable language; if I have erred, it is not in that direction. At the same time, it is a dangerous state of things if doctrine is made to drive out precept, and faith is held up as making holiness a superfluity. Sanctification must not be forgotten or overlaid by justification. We must teach plainly that the faith which saves the soul is not a dead faith, but a faith which operates with purifying effect upon our entire nature, and produces in us fruits of righteousness to the praise and glory of God. It is not by personal holiness that a man shall enter heaven, but yet without holiness shall no man see the Lord."

How stern the trial; how striking the triumph; how sublime, both in action and passion, was the faith of Abraham in that terrible crisis. It pleased God to try him on a very tender point. Abraham had received a great promise, on the fulfillment of which he greatly relied. Year after year elapsed, but no sign of the long-looked-for child appeared. At length old age crept over the patriarch and his wife. Still he looked steadfastly for the promise, because he believed implicitly in the Promiser. He considered not the infirmities of his own body, nor the deadness of Sarah's womb; but he waited patiently, nothing doubting that God would in due time, according to his promise, give him a son. What marvel that this son, when born, should be the object of his fondest affection! Moreover, a strange halo of hope gathers round the lad's head, for God has made him the heir of a covenant. It is in Isaac and in Isaac's seed that God will fulfill his covenant which he has made with Abraham. Nay, something more mysterious still is linked with that youth's life. It is in him that all the nations of the earth must be blessed. And now when the Lord says, â€œTake thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest,â€ there is a cut in every word at the most tender part of Abraham's soul."

IF this ninth chapter of John is intended to be a continuation of the history contained in the eighth, as we think it is, it brings before us a very extraordinary fact. You will observe in the eighth chapter that our Lord was about to be stoned by the Jews; he therefore withdrew himself from the circle of his infuriated foes, and passed through the crowd, not I think in a hurried manner, but in a calm and dignified way, as one not at all disconcerted, but wholly self-possessed. His disciples, who had seen his danger, gathered round him while he quietly retreated. The group wended their way with firm footsteps till they reached the outside of the temple. At the gate there sat a man well known to have been blind from his birth; our Savior was so little flurried by the danger which had threatened him, that he paused and fixed his eye upon the poor beggar, attentively surveying him. He stayed his onward progress to work the miracle of this man's healing. If it be so that the two chapters make up but one narrative, and I think it is, though we are not absolutely sure, then we have before us a most memorable instance of the marvellous calmness of our Savior while under danger..."

Our faith is fixed on him; our affections are drawn to him; our hopes all bend toward him. Though everything he said or did is precious, yet Jesus himself stands first in our estimation. To know him, to believe him, to love him, is the very essence of our Christianity. Tonight we change our theme. There is a “himself” in our text this evening- a “himself” ‘tis true of a much humbler order. How stand we each one for himself? Our individuality and the personal responsibilities which fall upon ourselves in reference to Christ must not be lost sight of. If, for instance, a spiritual miracle has been wrought upon us, if we are obliged to confess-nay, if we are delighted to confess-that he has opened our eyes, then we are bound, especially those of us who are of ripe understanding, who may be said to be of full age, we are bound to bear our own personal testimony to him. The allegation and the appeal may alike apply to each one of us, “He is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.” Jesus Christ himself bore our sins, as we heard this morning.

THE doctrine of the resurrection of the dead is peculiarly a Christian belief. With natural reason, assisted by some little light lingering in tradition, or borrowed from the Jews, a few philosophers spelled out the immortality of the soul; but that the body should rise again, that there should be another life for this corporeal frame, was a hope which is brought to light by the revelation of Christ Jesus. Men could not have imagined so great a wonder, and they prove their powerlessness to have invented it, by the fact, that still, as at Athens, when they hear of it for the first time, they fall to mocking. “Can these dry bones live?” is still the unbeliever's sneer.

IT is not often that a man may safely speak about his own humility. Humble men are mostly conscious of great pride, while those who are boastful of humility have nothing but false pretense, and really lack and want it. I question whether any of us are at all judges as to our pride or humility; for verily, pride so often assumes the shape of lowliness when it hath its own end to serve, and lowliness on the other hand is so perfectly compatible with a heavenly dignity of decision, that it is not easy at all times to discover which is the counterfeit and which is the precious and genuine coin. You will remember that in the case in our text, Paul speaks by inspiration. If it were not for this fact, I would not have believed even Paul himself when he spoke of his own humility. So distrustful do I feel of our judgment upon this point, that if he had not spoken under the infallible witness and guidance of the Holy Spirit, I should have said that the text was not true, and that when a man should say he served God with humbleness of mind, speaking merely from his own judgment, there was clear proof before you that he was a proud man.

MODERN professors have discovered a very easy way of religion. There is a method by which a man may attain to great reputation as a Christian, and yet avoid all the trials of the believer's estate. He may go through the world finding his path as smoothly turfed as the flesh could desire. Blessed with the smiles of friendly formalists, and with the admiration of the ungodly, he may pass from his first entrance into the Church to his grave without experiencing so much as a single shower to damp his delight; but, on the contrary, the sun may smile sweetly upon him all the way, the birds may sing, not a raven may dare to croak, not a single owl may hoot; his road to glory and immortality shall be all that ease could wish. Let him adopt the modern theory of universal charity; let him believe that a lie is a truth, and that whether it be a lie or a truth is of no consequence at all; let him be complacent towards every man; and with a smooth and oily tongue, chime in with every other man's principles, having none of his own worth mentioning; let him trim his sails whenever the wind changes; let him in all things do in Rome as Rome does; let him yield at all times to the current and float gently with the stream, and he shall come to the haven -though I fear..."

WHILE reading this description given by John of what he saw in the isle called Patmos, I think you must have noticed that it would be quite impossible for any painter to depict it upon canvas, and equally impossible for any sculptor to embody it in stone or marble. Those who have attempted to copy the lines here given have signally failed; they may paint a picture of the garment down to the feet, and the golden girdle; but the rest, if it be viewed from an artist's aspect, would be found to be incongruous: “His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire.” No great painter would ever venture to give us a portrait of our Lord with his head and his hair “white like wool, as white as snow.” If he did, it would be quite impossible to depict eyes that were “as a flame of fire.” How would it be possible to make us realize, with the aid of any pen or pencil, that his feet were “like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace”?"

THIS method of questioning the person to be instructed is known to teachers as the Socratic method. Socrates was wont, not so much to state a fact, as to ask a question and draw out thoughts from those whom he taught. His method had long before been used by a far greater teacher. Putting questions is Jehovah's frequent method of instruction. When the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind it was with a series of questions. “Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth? Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee? Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we are?” and so forth. Questions from the Lord are very often the strongest affirmations. He would have us perceive their absolute certainty. They are put in this particular form because he would have us think over his great thought, and confirm it by our own reflections. The Lord shines upon us in the question, and our answer to it is the reflection of his light. The Infallible One challenges a contradiction, or even a doubt. “Is anything too hard for me?” is the strongest way of saying that nothing can be too hard for him..."

MEMORY is very often the servant of despondency. Despairing minds call to remembrance every dark foreboding in the past, and every gloomy feature in the present. Memory stands like a handmaiden, clothed in sackcloth, presenting to her master a cup of mingled gall and wormwood. Like Mercury, she hastes, with winged heel, to gather fresh thorns with which to fill the uneasy pillow, and to bind fresh rods with which to scourge the already bleeding heart. There is, however, no necessity for this. Wisdom will transform memory into an angel of comfort. That same recollection which may in its left hand bring so many dark and gloomy omens, may be trained to bear in its right hand a wealth of hopeful signs. She need not wear a crown of iron, she may encircle her brow with a fillet of gold, all spangled with stars. When Christian, according to Bunyan, was locked up in Doubting Castle, memory formed the crab-tree cudgel with which the famous giant beat his captives so terribly. They remembered how they had left the right road, how they had been warned not to do so, and how in rebellion against their better selves, they wandered into By-path Meadow. They remembered all their past misdeeds, their sins, their evil thoughts and evil words, and all these were so many knots in the cudgel..."

FROM nine till noon the usual degree of light was present; so that there was time enough for our Lord's adversaries to behold and insult his sufferings. There could be no mistake about the fact that he was really nailed to the cross; for he was crucified in broad daylight. We are fully assured that it was Jesus of Nazareth, for both friends and foes were eye-witnesses of his agonies: for three long hours the Jews sat down and watched him on the cross, making jests of his miseries. I feel thankful for those three hours of light; for else the enemies of our faith would have questioned whether in very deed the blessed body of our Master was nailed to the tree, and would have started fancies as many as the bats and owls which haunt the darkness. Where would have been the witnesses of this solemn scene if the sun had been hidden from morn till night? As three hours of light gave opportunity for inspection and witness-bearing, we see the wisdom which did not allow it to close too soon. Never forget that this miracle of the closing of the eye of day at high noon was performed by our Lord in his weakness."

Just at that season when man goeth forth to reap the fruit of his labors, when the harvest of the earth is ripe, and the barns are beginning to burst with the new wheat, Death too, the mighty reaper, has come forth to cut down his harvest; full sheaves have been gathered into his garner â€” the tomb, and terrible have been the wailings which compose the harvest hymn of death.

SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON. “Out of weakness were made strong.”-Hebrews 11:34. SOME kinds of weakness are of God's appointment, and necessarily incident to manhood; they are not sinful, and, therefore, we may continue to be subject to them without regret. In reference to such weaknesses it may be that after beseeching the Lord even thrice to remove them, it may be for our good that they should remain. Then will our gracious God give us, in place of removing the weakness, this reply, “My grace shall be sufficient for thee.” This is a case of in weakness made strong, and there are many of God's saints who daily experience so blessed a privilege. They are weak, and continue weak; they have infirmities which they once wished to have removed, but which now they are content to bear; for now they are of the same mind with the apostle, that they glory in their infirmity, because when they are weak they are strong. But, dear friends, there is another kind of weakness which is sinful, a weakness which springs not from nature but from fallen nature; not from God's appointment, but from our sinfulness, and out of this we should desire to be delivered. We cannot pray for strength in sinful weakness, but must earnestly plead for strength to come out of it and to be made strong."

THIS is placed in connection with a large number of brief but very weighty precepts. Prayer has a distinct relationship to all Christian duties and graces. It is not possible for us to carry out the holy commands of our Lord Jesus unless we are abundant in supplication. The Romans at the time that Paul wrote to them were subject to persecution, and in this verse he mentions two remedies for impatience under such afflictions, remedies which are equally effectual under all the trials of life. The old physicians tell us of two antidotes against poison, the hot and the cold, and they dilate upon the special excellence of each of these: in like manner the apostle Paul gives us first the warm antidote - “Rejoicing in hope,” and then he gives us the cool antidote, “Patient in tribulation.” Either of these, or both together, will work wonderfully for the sustaining of the spirit in the hour of affliction; but it is to be observed, that neither of these remedies can be taken into the soul except they be mixed with a draught of prayer. Joy and patience are curative essences, but they must be dropped into a glass full of supplication, and then they will be wonderfully efficient. How can we “rejoice in hope” if we know nothing about prayer to the God of hope."

To a casual reader, it looks as if the meaning of this passage lay upon the very surface; but he who has studied the chapter carefully has discovered that it is a sentence replete with many difficulties as to the exact interpretation of it. I shall not, however, waste your time by entering into any critical discussion of it; but shall only try to give you simply what I believe to be the mind of the Spirit, as uttered by the lips of Jesus in this passage; and after I have done that, I shall then revert to what I shall call the meaning which any person would give to it who is not a diligent and careful student of Scripture. That meaning being true, although not the special truth taught in this passage, I shall briefly enlarge upon it. “It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing.” I suppose there is not a man in the world who could form any intelligent idea of what a spirit is. It is very easy for persons to define a spirit by saying what it is not; but I query whether there is, or ever could be, any man who could form any idea of what it is. We sometimes talk about seeing a spirit; ignorant persons in ages gone by, and some living now in benighted villages, talk about seeing spirits by night."

Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.” — John 18:37. THE season is almost arrived when by the custom of our fellow-citizens we are led to remember the birth of the holy child Jesus, who was born “king of the Jews.” I shall not, however, conduct you to Bethlehem, but to the foot of Calvary; there we shall learn, from the Lord's own lips, something concerning the kingdom over which he rules, and thus we shall be led to prize more highly the joyous event of his nativity. We are told, by the apostle Paul, that our Lord Jesus Christ before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession. It was a good confession as to the manner of it, for our Lord was truthful, gentle, prudent, patient, meek, and yet, withal, uncompromising, and courageous. His spirit was not cowed by Pilate's power, nor exasperated by his sneers. In his patience he possessed his soul, and remained the model witness for the truth — both in his silence and in his speech. He witnessed a good confession also, as to the matter of it; for, though he said but little, that little was all that was needful."

IN the first part of my discourse this morning I shall strictly keep to my text, as the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and endeavor to show what it teaches us with regard to him. These are his own words, and it would be robbery to borrow them until first we have seen what they meant as they fell from his lips. Their most golden meaning must be seen in the light of his sacred countenance. Then, in the second part of my sermon, I shall try to point out how the petition before us may be used by ourselves, and I pray that divine grace may be given us that it may be engraven upon our hearts, and that each one of us may be taught by the Holy Spirit daily to say for himself, “Father, glorify thy name.” I would suggest That these words should be to all the Lord's people in this church their motto for another year, and, indeed, their prayer throughout life. It will as well beseem the beginner in grace as the ripe believer; it will be proper both at the wicket-gate of faith, and at the portals of glory. Like a lovely rainbow let the prayer, “Father, glorify thy name,” over-arch the whole period of our life on earth. I cannot suggest a better petition for the present moment, nor indeed for any moment of our pilgrimage. Let us close the old year with it, and open the door of the new to the same note."

This passage also has a very strong message to those who are not Christians. Our society has separated character and integrity from the ability to do a job. Our culture used to know better. Where are our virtues? In God's sight, ministry and service in the house of the Lord is integrally linked to character. When looking at 1 Timothy 3 and Titus 1, the requirements for elders and deacons, only one is related intellectual ability. The rest are character issues. Yet ordination services often appear to focus mainly on theological issues. It may be that you are like those in 7:51, religious, but stiff-necked, spiritually dead. Do not do what those men did. Today is the day of salvation. The gospel is freely offered to you. The Lord is still a God of Mercy. Lay hold of the Lord Jesus Christ."

There is incredible power in the deceptiveness of the human heart. God is calling us to be single focused and to agree with His truth so that our heart will not be veiled with the deceit of religion.

We as Christians have to make a choice to live in this world as a testimony of the keeping power of God. The cry of the church should be, “Lord, stretch forth you hand and heal through me. Use my life to bring healing and freedom to those who are lost.” What will revival look like? All people with a no name ministry will suddenly show up with the glory of God on them. Grandmothers who laid hold of the Cross will begin to speak to a younger generation. Young people like David in the Bible who will not cower under the pressure of this society will rise up with a cry that says, \"is there not a cause?\" There is coming a season when God will turn the people’s hearts back to Him and He will pour out His Spirit on all flesh."

Satan convinces man that it is of value to live life by self effort. It is this kind or reasoning that leads us into despair. The way out of despair is understanding that Jesus Christ was brought into the deepest places of sin and darkness yet He has triumphed over them. When Jesus Christ went into the grave and resurrected from the dead He broke the power over the devil and despair. We must choose to let God be God in us. This is the finest hour for the Church of Jesus Christ. God is calling us to get up and shake ourselves out of the dust."

The end is that the life of Jesus Christ is lived out in each one of his people (48 minutes)."

But whilst casting down false strongholds, he is also faithful to build up that which is true, clearly setting out what is the TRUE gospel of Christ, of which the Apostle was not ashamed. When that gospel is preached, we should be asking men, not “Do you know you’re a sinner?” but “Has God so worked in your heart that the sin you once loved you now hate?”; not “Have you made a decision?” but “Has God worked in your heart?”; not “Do you want to go to heaven?” but ”Has God so worked in your heart that you now esteem him worthy above all things, and desire HIM?”. Mr Washer includes examples of some Godly conversions, which clearly bear the fruits of  that miraculous and supernatural repentance and regeneration which are the work of God alone. (50 minutes)."

The closing words of  what some men choose to call ‘The Sermon On The Mount’ are a perfect example of this sword at work, dividing between strait and wide; narrow and broad; good trees and bad trees; good fruit and bad fruit; those that hear Jesus’ words and do them, and those that hear Jesus’ words and do them not; life and death; salvation and destruction; heaven and hell. As Mr Washer asserts, these are indeed fearful words, and he expounds them clearly and powerfully to the end that his hearers should be left in no doubt as to the eternal consequences of Jesus’ teaching. How many preachers ‘blunt’ this sword in their attempts to make the message more ‘acceptable’ (as they think) to men; but Mr Washer cares too much for the souls he is addressing to compromise their eternal safety. If you’re content to think that you’re saved just because you ‘asked Jesus into your heart’ one time; and you don’t want your faith to be tried and proved, whether it is actually of God or not; then don’t bother listening to this message!  But I pray that you will listen to it, both for your own eternal safety, and for the pleasure and glory of God.   (68 minutes)"

This shows that the gospel is not something learned in five minutes, after which we go on to ‘deeper things’. The gospel of Jesus Christ is the deepest and greatest truth in all scripture – and we still won’t understand its greatness after an eternity of eternities. People are not excited about the gospel these days, because they don’t know it, and they don’t understand the fullness of it. Mr Washer pulls no punches: “If Jesus Christ and his gospel do not excite you, you are going to hell”, he pleads, before going on to explain what he means. He argues the great need for preachers of the true gospel, and explains what it means to receive the gospel, and how we may know that we have received it. What is your motivation for coming to Jesus Christ? Security? Healing? A new Mercedes? Or do you come for salvation? But what about coming to Christ simply because he is worthy? That alone ought to be motivation enough to repent and believe. This potent and searching message ends with a sober warning of the perils of ignoring this gospel. (50 minutes)"

God has the power to break us into pieces and consume us, and He would be be completely justified in doing so, but it is not in His heart to do so. Christmas is a season that reminds us that no matter how many times we fail Him, He sent His son Jesus to carry us through our journey. God walks with those who walk with Him. He restores, He gives strength, He gives hope and provision. This season we are lovingly reminded that the supernatural life of Christ is entwined with the natural life of man and we become a new creation. This Christmas listen to the still small voice of Jesus and let Him fill your heart with JOY."

He joined the Free Church in 1843, and was its moderator in 1878. He was identified with evangelical and revival movements and adhered to the doctrine of premillennialism. With Robert Murray McCheyne he visited Palestine in 1839 to inquire into the condition of the Jews there. During the visit of Dwight L. Moody to Britain in 1874 and 1875, Moody was warmly welcomed by Bonar, despite the latter receiving considerable criticism from other Calvinist ministers in the Free Church."

He reveals his own love for Godly men of old, who thought great thoughts about God, and whose writings have been influential in his own life. Reading from some of their writings, as well as his own notes, he explains something of what Isaiah saw. The Apostle John shows that Isaiah saw a revelation of the Son (thereby proving his eternal deity), yet Isaiah saw only an image, reduced to what his finite capacity could receive. Holiness is so much more than we think; holiness is the highest statement which could ever be made in regard to God; it speaks of separateness and uniqueness. And what is the effect of its revelation? We are faced with our own uncleanness and nothingness in the presence of a holy God; yet at the same time a Saviour is revealed to us in his condescending love. Let all flesh be abased, that God’s glory may be the more elevated. (73 minutes)"

We are to reflect a new value system which is the giving of ourselves in the same way that Christ gave for us. The central core of Christ is that He came to the world not to do His own will but to do the will of the Father. The will of the Father is that none would perish. The cry of your heart in these last days should be LORD BREAK ME!"

Before one becomes a partaker of the divine nature, Major Thomas expounds what man in fact is.  We discover he is a living soul wrapped in flesh, needing the Spirit of God to breathe life into his Spirit.  Once the man is forgiven his goal must become, through grace, to allow and yield the Spirit’s infiltration into jis soul and flesh that he may become an instrument of righteousness. "

First, the voice of God will never promise us peace if we are embracing the same value system of the world. Second, the voice of God will challenge sin. In the dark days ahead the people of God will be lead into the tender mercies of God. God will give us a heart full of confidence when we choose to live uprightly."

If we are called by God the powers of darkness know the potential we have in Christ. When we come to our red sea of impossibility God promises every enemy will be drowned behind us. There is a glory that will come upon a people who choose to get into the Word of God and simply declare the impossible possible. There will be a people in this last hour of time who have the testimony of Jesus Christ and a glory song that the world must reckon with. This day captivity will be broken and your song will be, \"only God can do this\"!! It is time to go forward into the miraculous!"

Secondly, Christians can testify of times of prayer when the presence and power of God fill the heart almost to bursting; it is not so with the Jehovah’s Witness, for God is not with them.

There was rarely a full sermon given where the gospel message was preached, but yet hundreds of people were being converted and revived. The main focus of the message is to clean up our lives as Christians, and then God the Holy Ghost will do the work; we just have to get out of the way. Don't organize, don't build it up, just let God work, be obediant to Him, and our prayers will then be answered."

Christ came to take away sin (Vs. 5) and destroy the work of the devil (Vs. 8). The logical conclusion is that whoever is born of God (Vs. 9) and consequently abides in Him (Vs. 6) does not go on sinning and whoever does go on sinning has not seen God and has not known him (V. 6); he is not of God (Vs. 10)."

There is a trend today in modern charismatic circles to exorcise Satan when sin appears in the life; sin is attributed entirely to Satan as though man was the helpless victim. This trend diminishes the doctrine of Total Depravity and also the responsibility of man for his own actions. John does not regard sin as the devil working through the individual, but as the individual working for the devil and in his sin representing the devil. Sin is not a mere infirmity; it is not merely an imposition of Satan on us. John is emphasising that habitual sin is wilful lawlessness against God (Vs. 4) and the man who continues to sin is not at liberty to say ‘the devil made me do it' by direct involvement. "

Going to church on Sunday's and maybe on Wednesday's doesn't mean you are in church or evening having fellowship. It is silly to say that we are going to church...when we are the church. What kind of fellowship can you have in church? Usually we are sitting in pews for an hour, shake some hands in between breaks and then when it is over you go home or maybe even out to lunch!? "

Many preachers say little more about meekness than showing that is not weakness; but what does the word really mean? The true meaning of any word is defined not merely through a dictionary, but by studying the context of the passage(s) where it occurs; so, using the obvious parallels between Matthew 5:5 and Psalm 37:11, Mr Washer uses the context of Psalm 37:1-11 to define the word ‘meek’. He works through the verses one by one, revealing the character of the meek man: he does not fret, nor envy the wicked; he trusts in God and dwells in the land; he delights himself in the Lord, commits his way unto the Lord, rests in the Lord, and so on. “This is what it means to be meek”, says Mr Washer, “and it is one of our greatest needs today”.

Paul Washer humbly yet with boldness speaks forth as the Oracles of God to a crowd of 5000 baptist youth. Would be to God that more would speak with a clear conscience of true Christian virtue and repentance."

This visitation comes to gives us a heart for the poor and when the Spirit of God is flowing through us spiritual poverty is broken.

In these last days God will bring the truth of Christ back into focus through His church. When this religious system sees the children of God who are empowered by the Holy Spirit and walking in the joy of Jesus, then many will turn back to the Lord in this generation. Religion will forever bend its knee when there is a God-gripped people in the midst."

As children of God we are admonished not to withdraw our hands in self preservation, but rather to stretch out our hand to the poor and needy.

Then, after exhorting fathers in the fulfilling of their Biblical responsibilities, he turns to Romans 12:1-2 where the apostle Paul urges us to give our lives away; not for a cause, but to a Person. Our motivation for doing so is ‘the mercies of God’, which Mr Washer then explains. This laying down of one’s life is a once-and-for-all decision; but why does Paul say, Present your bodies? For one thing, it destroys the notion that a man can outwardly live in ungodliness whilst claiming that in his heart he really loves Jesus Christ. Furthermore, the things we do in our bodies are evidence of our sanctification and dedication to God. Mr Washer also examines in some detail what we put in to our bodies, revealing our responsibilities before God and men. He then considers in turn our eyes, ears, tongue, hands and feet, and how we clothe our bodies; he pleads with us to do all things to the glory of God.  (46 minutes)."

Parents are not teaching their children their responsibilities, and the church is not showing the parents how. Biblical counsel is this: don’t put yourself in the way of temptation. This issue is not a question of the intellect, it’s a question of the will: we know what’s right, we just don’t want to do it. Proceeding into v.2,  Mr Washer explains what it means to be not conformed to this world, both for individuals and for the church. He explains that the renewing of the mind is a total transformation, a supernatural creative work of God. He then examines the will of God, and how you will know it by its characteristics of being good, acceptable and perfect. This message outlines practical issues that we all have to deal with. Believing the doctrine is one thing; but is it a growing, practical reality in your life? If not, stop and deal with it, one step at a time.  (43 minutes)"

He also explains what should be preached, and how, and likens labouring with souls to the travails of birth. We must understand that the gospel is unbelievable, and is scandalous; if we remove the scandal, we remove the power. This world is ripe for a move of God: What a time to be alive!!, he exclaims (67 minutes). "

The Bible says to keep asking and we will receive. But what are we asking for? This message makes an appeal to us to put away childish prayers that are self-focused and begin to ask for the power and provision we need to minister to fallen humanity. Ask God for a heart for this world and an awareness of how much He loves people. Those who are looking away from self and are given for the work of God will be given supernatural strength in the coming storm!"

In these seasons we have a tendency to question God's faithfulness and doubt that He will answer our prayers. When our problems go from bad to worse and the answer doesn’t seem to come, there is a bitterness that begins to rise up. We can do one of two things. We can either turn to the Lord and trust in His Word or charge God with \"Fatherly negligence\". God knows and cares! We have a heavenly Father who knows about agony so much so that He allowed His own Son to die on a cross and suffer so that we may be comforted in all our afflictions. God Knows and God Cares!"

The question is, “What do we do with this cup of salvation”? This message points to examples in history where people were given a great opportunity to serve God but became self indulgent. The self indulgent church has nothing in his heart for his brother. It gravitates to the things of the world and its possessions, instead of living for Christ. There is a final warning to the self indulgent church to turn away from their sins and become charitable to the poor. There is a time when a sentence is written against those who were supposed to be a testimony in the earth. Recognizing and honoring truth is not enough, we must embrace it and walk it out! In one minute everything can change and only those who have the compassion of God for humanity will stand!"

She speaks about the revival in China, and how teenage girls leave their homes and walk from village to village sharing Jesus. They come back two years later and multitudes have accepted Christ. These girls have never been to a seminar or a worship service. They simply give everything they have away. Jackie also witnesses about brothers and sisters coming out of decades in prison with broken bodies many times, but rejoicing and shining in their Saviour. She emphasizes that the revival in China is not facilitated by visual aids, life changing tapes, videos of the month or Christian magazines. It comes through the Holy Spirit using \"just a few people who aren't very educated, without microphones, who loved their lives not unto death - that's it.\" In this way, God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise (1 Corinthians 1:26-27). Jesus came to preach the good news to the poor (Luke 4:18). Jackie explains how the poor are often able to hear the gospel much quicker than an educated person, because they can hear spiritually. This is why the poor in spirit are blessed (Matthew 5:3). Jackie Pullinger emphasizes that men and women are saved through the Spirit of God, not through man's reasoning. She concludes with a call to die and a profound challenge: \"His glory will fall if you go out with nothing except a broken heart and some precious seed, and I suppose we have all got that.\""

The Bible says that Jesus took upon Himself the form of a servant and in doing this He teaches us that heavens order is completely reversed from the world's order. The Word of God is performed in those whom have a servant's heart. Serving Christ and then serving others unlocks power and revelation. You may feel trampled, pounded, unappreciated and passed by but as a servant you have found the secret of spiritual strength! Take heed; the last will be first and the first will be last!"

When God first speaks His promises to us there is strong expectancy for the fulfillment of that promise. But as time passes on and we are still waiting the possible begins to seem impossible. It is in these times of delay that our flesh will begin to think that we can make things happen in our own time and our own way. God in His mercy will bring us through the refiner's fire so we can let go of all that we think we are and what we think we are supposed to do.

Preaching in Denmark, he opens with a plea for men who have a zeal for the Lord’s house, who will stand up and be counted, and will seize the opportunities for preaching the gospel while they exist. Moving on to Chapter 1 of Mark’s gospel, he shows how demanding life can be for the zealous man of God, as exemplified in the ministry of Jesus Christ himself. If the Son of God could not live on earth without prayer and secret communion with his Father, how much less can we. He was never too busy to pray; nor should we be. Everything we are in public, is formed by what we are in private when we are alone with God, says Mr Washer; and he then goes on to use the Luke 18 passage to expound the topic of persevering prayer, showing both how and why we should endure in prayer, how God delights in it, and what it can achieve.

He will take away all things that we believe He has given us, when in reality He never did. In this place God will deal with all that has captivated our heart and would hinder His life from being lived through us. In the wilderness the natural becomes supernatural and we are brought back to a right perspective. When we get through this deep dealing of God we are enabled to make the choice to be poured out for Jesus so that others can be grafted into His power and lineage.

Firstly, Paul Washer explains how the disciples must have felt as Jesus came to them after his resurrection: weak, doubting, and so aware that all their claims to devotion had failed. Yet how patient God is, and Mr Washer expounds the blessed promises concerning the smoking flax and bruised reed. He then says that much of today’s preaching takes away from the glory of Christ, because it puts into the future what the New Testament declares is now. Christ said, All power is (now) given unto me. Turning to Psalm 2, Mr.Washer shows how and why the heathen rage against the gospel of Jesus Christ; but God mocks them, for he has established his King, and all authority is given to Him. We should not fear those who oppose the gospel, not should we be angry; we should pity them – and Mr Washer shares his own experience when arrested by police in Peru. He then expounds ‘the Son of Man’ (Daniel 7:13) in the context of Christ’s kingdom. Conspiracy theories? There are no such thing! says Mr Washer; man can do NOTHING unless Jesus Christ decrees it. Jesus Christ is king, NOW!  71 minutes."

Ask for your heart to be broken for the lost. Ask for the strength to take up your cross and follow Jesus. We are to seek first His kingdom. Seek the heart and the will of God and He promises that all we need will be given to us and at the end of the day we will have joy!"

There is a spiritual war waging around us at all times and many of us need to engage in this battle.  The problem is that we first have to win the battle within.  We have to allow grace to have its perfect work in our lives, we have to believe that God loves our souls and sent his son to die for them.  Ron Reed discusses how too many people view Christianity as a passive experience, and points out how the Devil will devour and pick off stragglers very easily when they fail to engage in the Spiritual warfare against their own inner voice or soul.  A strong exhortation is given to actively engage in a devotional life with God that encompasses meditation on the word and prayer.  He also discussed how one of the principle weapons the enemy uses against us is speculation.  "

We all have a sin nature in us that desires to make choices apart from the will of God. God gave us the law as a school master to prove to us that we can't keep it. When we try to struggle our way out of a situation we are being God in that area. When we try to defeat sin in our own strength we are being God in that area. God the Father and Jesus Christ made a covenant with each other to put an end to sin and the power it has over us. It is only when we bend our knee to God and put our faith in the finished work of the Cross the struggle stops and God can be God to us. WE don't make promises to God, He makes them to us and He keeps them. It is not about works, it is all about faith in what Christ has already done."

There are seasons in our life when God will allow forms of sorrow into our heart for His own purpose. Sometimes God will allow times of isolation so we can stop and think about His ways in order to get an eternal perspective. If you are feeling alone this message reminds us that it was the shepherds that were isolated out in the field who got the revelation of Jesus. It was Simeon a lonely man who waited for the comfort of Christ. And it was Anna, a widow who was no stranger to sorrow. Has it ever occurred to you that isolation and loneliness might be mandatory for us to see Christ in the midst of crisis. In the last days it talks about a bride filled with oil who will see Him in calamity. Those who have suffered will be filled with oil so they see the nearness of Christ and His power.

When the Son of God knocks on the door of your heart to put what you know about Him into practice, how will you respond? We are called to take everything God has given to us and use it for the betterment of human suffering. This doesn't make sense to the natural man who will choose self preservation and stay locked behind a closed door fellowship. If you reach out to the widow and the hungry in a time of famine, the treasure of Jesus Christ will be unlocked to you. When we turn our hearts away from helping the poor and needy, we rob ourselves of the presence of God. Jesus stands at the door and knocks and if you will open the door He will give you provision to feed the hungry, clothe the naked and touch the heart of a sin-sick world. Let your heart come into agreement with what God speaks for your life. If you have resisted this call Jesus is willing to knock again."

If we are not able to behold the cross, and see how God demonstrated himself, how will our idolitries be abolished?  To the degree that our perception of God is distorted, so also are we distorted.  With unconventional wisdom, Art Katz relishes in all that the cross will afford its most ardent adherents.  He bids the church to drop their porcelain and sentimental attachments to creedal views of Calvary.  We are warned in this sermon that a Christianity which is ever fixated upon the initial salvation level the cross affords, will never challenge the status quo in this world. "

From the garden on through the resurrection circumstances revealed.  No more were they boasting of their capacity to be the greatest.  During the dark night of the crisis of the Christ, all was revealed.  It is in this that the Apostle Paul gloried, nothing other than the cross of Christ, for nothing else has the capacity to reveal what we are.   The sufferings of Christ, viewed with sincerity, will always beget personal revelation.  We must be apprehended by the cross.  If this is not the case, then we will be absolutely unable to serve God in any form of spiritual community.  Just like it was a suffering for Christ to display the truth of who he was, so also, our apprehension of the truth of what we are will be suffering. "

It is stated herein that one of the greatest libels against the cross in our day is the idea that the believer in the cross is absented from any form of suffering.  It is the cruciform life which will generate a necessary friction against the kingdoms of this world.  We must apprehend that this conflict is an intention of God through his people, and in every sense, a diet of the things of this world will by nature slicken any apprehension of this cross-centered friction.   The hearing of this sermon in its deepest of intentions will bring you face to face with Jesus calling you Satan, that is to say...you are Satanic if you cherish not the things of God over the things of man. We are admonished to take up the cross and follow Christ for, \"Natural man is always the instrument by which Satanic things are brought into being in the collision between kingdoms.\" "

Part of a series on Ephesians entitled Grace in the Heavenlies, this message explores the glory of the grace of God in the redemption we have through the blood of Jesus Christ. Christianity does not end with forgiveness, it begins with it, and God is forming a people for Himself who have known His forgiveness and therefore know Him as He really is: the God of unsearchable grace. \"...That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.\" (Ephesians 1:12)"

And you, who once were alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now He has reconciled in the body of His flesh through death, to present you holy, and blameless, and above reproach in His sight.\" (Colossians 1:19-22) Contrary to what we might feel, God does not reluctantly forgive sins but He is pleased and full of joy to reconcile His enemies unto Himself. It pleased the Lord to crush His Son for our sakes, and when we apprehend this wonderful knowledge of God's good pleasure in the gospel, our hearts will be liberated and our lives transformed."

		"description" : "This message was preached on August 30th, 2009, at Valley Church in Smithfield, Utah. \"For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men.\" (Romans 1:18) Foundational to the gospel as well as to the whole Bible, the reality of the wrath of God has almost become a thing of embarrassment for many Christians, but if we do not know God as the God revealed in Scripture - a God of wrath - then we really do not know God at all. God's wrath is as much a divine perfection as His love, and therefore it is something marvelous for us to rejoice in."

There is so much misunderstanding and confusion that surrounds the issue of election, and my hope is that this message will clear much of that away. The Church must not be ashamed of, or apologize for, God, and one of the greatest hindrances to our coming into the fullness of the stature of Christ is our failure to embrace this essential God glorifying truth: that salvation is all of God and not of man."

For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written. The just shall live by faith.\" (Romans 1:16-17) The Gospel which saves us is the power of God and the wisdom of God; for no one was saved by their own power, nor their own wisdom, but by the working alone of God's mighty power. The greatest need of man is righteousness with God, but it is also his greatest impossibility. Only through the Gospel is that righteousness secured, not by the strength and will of the flesh, but by the power and wisdom and God."

We are no longer distinguished as separate, consecrated, pilgrims, sojourners, or holy unto the Lord; instead, we have eyes full of the world, hearts in love with the world, ears attentive to the world, lips filled with worldly speech, hands filled with worldly things, feet comfortable with worldly paths, and bodies no longer ready to depart and be with Jesus since that would mean giving up the world."

Our prayers are with the family and we as a church body are committed to standing with them at this time of sorrow.  - Pastor Carter Conlon"

They were haughty and did detestable things before me. Therefore I did away with them as you have seen\" Ezekiel 16:49. Jackie gives a short, deep and challenging call to go and minister to the poor with a broken heart. Her message is followed by personal testimonies. The recording ends in weeping over the hardness of our hearts and for the poor. Real ministry is to show people the Lord of the Word: \"They will know what He is like by what you are like. So you live it with your life and they will read you like an epistle.\" Whenever the destitute cry out, God will respond by sending a person, and it could be you. God works through people. Jackie also points out that the poor don't need training in evangelism, as evangelism is simply \"one poor man telling another poor man where to find bread\"."

Itâ€™s a bad, bad sign when I examine everybody elseâ€”shows that I havenâ€™t seen myself, I have lost sight of my own great need.  You know, thatâ€™s the mark of true Christian.  He examines himself in the presence of God and he judges no man.  Jesus was like that.  But it would be good, and it is good, and it must be good for us to examine ourselves, or to let God examine us.  â€œExamine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith, whether Christ be in you.â€ Iâ€™ve been sitting here praying for this one thing: that God might help in these days for us to see our great need.  What is our need?  Well, weâ€™re a perishing lotâ€”perishing.  â€œWoe is me.  I am undone.  Iâ€™m a man of unclean lips, and I dwell among a people of unclean lips.â€  Iâ€™m in a poisonous atmosphere.  â€œWho shall deliver me from the body of this death?â€  Thereâ€™s no deliverance except the thing that our brother spoke of: to be made new, absolutely new.  As long as we try to fix up the old, weâ€™ll only make an awful job out of it.  But, oh, if Jesus Christ has His way, heâ€™ll go His wayâ€”we will go His way.  And His way is just one way: â€œLearn of Me.  I am meek and lowly in heart.â€  Oh, is that my desire? "

And when all Israel backslid, he went up to the mountain to be alone with God, and he fell down forty days and forty nights, and he said, â€œO God, this people hath sinned a great sin,â€ and he prayed for themâ€”he interceded for them until God forgave their iniquity.  But then Moses wasnâ€™t through.  He said, â€œGod, show me now Thy glory.â€  Oh, to him, God was â€œall and in all.â€  And while the people had danced around the golden calf and given themselves to idolatry, Moses had but one aim.  And you and I have but one aim, no matter what others do, no matter how people backslide, no matter what they do with prayer, what they do with churchâ€”no matter what they do.  No matter how they give themselves to gossip, to criticizing, to pride, to ambition, to tending to things of earth, Iâ€™ve got but one program: to abide in the Lord Jesus Christ."

He crosses all denominational lines, and spares no one. Yet, when he is finished, and we look at ourselves and the North American church one cannot but wonder what will become of us if, as the brother points out, the church doesn’t get its act together. Can we really hope to survive, as a nation and as a people, if we continue to prefer our denominational dogmas, in the place of Scripture? The ramifications of this sermon are devastating."

In these last days there will be carpenters who look to the cross of Jesus and lead the people into the supernatural life of Christ. These carpenters will begin to rebuild the temple so that God's glory can be manifested one more time. The cry of the carpenter will be, “God raise up a testimony for Your glory one more time in these last days.”"

Those who love truth and allow that truth to produce a supernatural love in us will be found with oil in their lamps, preaching a message of love, redemption and forgiveness of sin. It is the love of Christ that leads us into His redemptive work. In a time when everything is coming against God there will be a people baptized with the love of God for every lost soul. The last day’s message is a message of relentless love."

Faith in the finished work of the cross brings us into the promises and power of God. God is with us in spite of our failures. He has all the resources we need to fill our temples with His Glory. Jesus is calling His church to be ambassadors of His Glory."

He calls us to stand between the sinfulness of society and the life of a merciful savior. God is looking for you to get into the prayer closet with His promises and touch His heart. The Lord looks for those who would entreat Him like a son or daughter and convince Him to show mercy before judgment."

He shows clearly why it is such a necessary and vital part of the Christian life, and what the effects and benefits of it are. In so doing, arguing always from the basis of scripture, he exposes the dangers of ‘Hyper-Calvinism’ (ie, ‘extreme’ views of the doctrines of election and predestination), which lead some to believe that things such as exhortation should not be necessary (65 minutes)."

At the end of our journey we will all give an account for what we did with His investment in us here on earth. Will you invest what God has given you in His redemptive work here on earth? Don't bury your talent, invest it."

God is not looking for all the things you can do for Him, He is longing for you to embrace Him. He does not want you to be a laborer in His life, He wants someone to love Him. Are you willing to love Jesus and embrace His will for your life? The candlestick is that which is in us that makes Christ attractive to others. It is time to get back to your first love."

I believe our nation, and particularly the church is at this cross road now. God has sent alarming signs to us to show us the path we are on and what is coming. And unless a proper response is done by the church, we will go down in the history books as, 'having eyes to see, but could not see; having ears to hear, but could not hear'.

But God and His Word had been forgotten, His law forsaken, and His loving grace taken for granted. Instead of the name of the Lord, Israel ran into two towers – their homes and their temples – prosperity and religion – and God promised to destroy both. Once any people begin to amass expensive homes, power over other people, and large incomes, it is easy for them to find their identity in these things. There is a natural tendency for people to consider their security to be in their stuff. They will go to great extremes to protect that which they imagine themselves to have gained by right – and anything that would threaten their power or their status or their revenue – they will act even in immoral ways to maintain what they presume to be rightfully their own.  Are we not falling into the same trap? Why should God not sweep away our western materialistic churches?"

The preaching of Peter may well have been the source of most of Mark’s material. Mark accounts for the ministry of Jesus from His Baptism to His Ascension. Most commentaries agree that Mark’s purpose was neither biographical nor historical, but theological: to present Jesus as the Christ, the mighty worker rather than great teacher. Hence, Mark makes fewer references to the Parables and discourses, but meticulously records each of Jesus’ \"mighty works\" as evidence of His divine power.

Its purpose is evangelical and is so stated in 20:31. John not only records events as do the other Gospels but also uniquely interprets the events by giving them spiritual meaning. The author makes significant use of such words as light, water, life, love, and bread. Traditionally the author of this Gospel is considered to have been John, the Beloved Disciple."

Beginning with the Ascension of Jesus to heaven, it traces the growth of Christianity in Palestine and its spread to Syria, Asia Minor, Greece, and eventually to Rome. The leading figure in the first chapters is Peter, who delivered the stirring sermon on the day of Pentecost (2). The greater part of the book, however, is devoted to the experiences of Paul and his companions during their missionary endeavors. The Book of Acts provides a useful background for study of the Pauline Epistles. The introduction (1:1) attests to a Lukan authorship."

Traditionally, John is identified with the author of the Fourth Gospel. Addressed to seven historical churches in Asia Minor, the Book of Revelation was written to warn against spiritual indifference and to elicit courage under persecution. Because of the extensive use of symbolism and picturesque imagery, its interpretation has posed many problem for the student of the Bible. While recognizing the historical situation (Roman persecution) that elicited this writing, many interpreters look upon it as a prophecy depicting events that were to take place at the end of the age. The ultimate victory of Christ is the dominant theme of this book."

Their despotic rulers and emperors thought they were independent of the God of heaven. The wicked nations thought that their kings had the ultimate and final authority. The kings and the princes of the Gentile world positioned themselves as if they were unpunishable. The prophecy here is a revelation from heaven that God, Who created the earth and all the inhabitants therein, has not abandoned the world to His creatures.

Some are quite awake physically but fast asleep spiritually. There are those who think Christmas is a time to booze, or a time to give way to their passions. Others put up beautiful decorations, but they don't know what Christmas is about. But at Christmas we celebrate the birth of the Son of our Heavenly Father into this world, who became man.

At the time Jeremiah gave this word there were also other false prophets saying that it would go bad with them in exile. But they were false prophets. Jeremiah told them to be obedient and God would be with them and give them a hope and a future in the foreign godless country. So they went into exile and found it to be a godless nation. But God rose up mighty men of God like Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. And they shook that nation through their lives and testimony and God's Word spread through that nation through their testimony. Not that they didn't meet up with difficulties, but as they remained faithful to God He delivered them and through it glorified God."

The cold caused him to want to sleep which is dangerous. Your brain can be frozen. When he woke up he said, \"Whatâ€™s happening? I feel warm.\" It was a bear from the forest. A bear is very dangerous. He found himself embraced by the bear. He said, \"Lord, you have sent a ferocious animal to help me.\" When he woke up, the bear also woke up.

We have enough of hypocrisy. We say we are Christians but we get angry and donâ€™t do anything about it. Genesis 1:26 God wanted man to rule over creation so that man would be the manager of creation. When God created man he wanted man to be like Him. He wanted to put man on earth so that he would represent God on earth. That was the heart of God when he created man. That was the duty of man on earth.

This text is an inspiration to every believer. The challenge is that the world is in our hands. If we repent and get right with God, our land will be healed and restored. We are not to point to the sin of other people but to ourselves and if we repent the Lord will heal our land. God requires that we humble ourselves.

Scientists say that when you look at pornography there are chemicals that are automatically released in the brain which changes the brain in such a way that it alters it's structure. Porn rewires you. Adam and Eve didn't know they were naked, but when they sinned they became aware of it and were ashamed. God Himself then slaughtered an animal and clothed them with the skins. This was a pointer towards the time when Jesus would be slaughtered for our sins on the Cross. The Bible says marriage should be honoured by all and the marriage bed undefiled, for God will judge the adulterers (Hebrews 13:4). Pornography is an evil drug, worse than dagga (marijuana) and many other drugs. Looking at pornography makes you a slave to it.

We are not exactly sure where they came from because it just says the East but it could have been China or one of those lands there. That doesnâ€™t trouble us exactly where they were from. But we know that they travelled very far to come to the Kong who had been born. Neither do we know who told them that this Child would be born. It is only the Bible that prophesies about His birth. There were no other historical references. But we do know there had been prophets like Daniel (who had lived most of his life in an Eastern kingdom) and others who had prophesied about it. The Magi saw the star and they said that indicated that the King had been born in Israel. Unfortunately, they presumed that if a king was born in Israel then he had to be born in Jerusalem, the capital. So they started their long journey to Jerusalem."

Often the children go off the track and if you look closely, you see the parents havenâ€™t taught them properly especially those with children a bit older. This applies to young people and to parents who must bring up their children properly. The Bible says â€œTeach your children in His way and then they will not deviate from it.â€ You parents and mothers, do you hear? Parents complain and say the children donâ€™t want to listen but the problem is with the parents. You canâ€™t blame poverty for it. It's usually those that are better off that go wrong. In the world you hear it is poverty that causes the problems. That is not true. If the parents follow the Lord faithfully, the children will follow in their footsteps."

Then he finds the house put in order and neat and he goes and finds seven others which he met in the wilderness, worse than himself, and they go and inhabit that person. Itâ€™s a dangerous thing to say youâ€™ve made a decision for Christ but you donâ€™t go all the way but only do it half-heartedly. The devil doesnâ€™t like it in the wilderness.

The Bible doesnâ€™t specifically say that but historians mention it. But the Bible does tell us that when He went to Gethsemane, He took with Him His disciples only to a certain point and three others a little further and left them too and He went still a little further and prayed earnestly, even so that His sweat drops were as blood. He was in a terrific battle, and He prayed and said, \"Father if itâ€™s possible let this cup pass from Me, nevertheless not My will but Your will be done\". That cup was filled with your sin and my sin - the sin of the world. He Who is the Holy Son of God became sin for us! Jesus was fully man and fully God."

Satan was an angel of the north walking among the others in heaven, until pride was found in him and he was thrown out of heaven (Is 14:12-14). A third of the angels in heaven joined satan in his rebellion and was cast out of heaven with him (Rev 12:3-4; 7-9). One cannot grasp it.

So whether you were born 12.01am or 11.59pm, almost 24h apart, your birthday would still be counted on that day!). So those three hours on Friday would be counted as a full day and night, according to the Jewish reckoning. Then you have the full Saturday (counting from the evening) and then part of Sunday again (starting in the evening again, counted as a full day and night) when He arose. The full time in the grave would then be counted, as per the Jews way of timekeeping, as three days and nights."

Youâ€™ve heard how his majesty said unashamedly that Jesus is His Lord before the whole world. Jesus said that he who is ashamed of Me, of him I will be ashamed before the Father and His holy angels (Luke 9:26). A certain very prominent judge in Germany has said that if all the evidence and witnesses in the Bible be judged in a court of law, the verdict would be clear that indeed Jesus had risen from the dead!

But what I found among the Christians were in opposition to this, the one would criticize the next; the other would complain that theyâ€™re not treated well or greeted properly. I knew that revival wouldnâ€™t start if things didnâ€™t come right among the Christians first, for the Bible says that judgment must begin in the house of God (1Pet 4:17). The reason the Word of God, the Bible, doesnâ€™t cover the earth, is not because of the heathen, but because of the Christians that arenâ€™t living according to the Word of God. Jesus said that the one who believes in Him as the Scripture has said, from his innermost being will flow rivers of Living Waters. Rivers of water cannot be stopped. You might try to stop a river by building a restraining wall in the river, but the water will only build up on the one side and eventually break the wall in a massive flood, or the water will rise up and flow over the wall."

As you go through life you will meet with many difficulties where all you can do is cry to the Lord, \"please save me from this\". As you meet up with things enough to make you afraid you will need the Lord to be your fortress. And when the wicked come up against you and those that hate you oppose you, then you will need the Lord to be with you that you can overcome.

But what is shocking is that that passage goes on to say that the children of the Kingdom will be cast out! Every child of God should test and examine himself that he is not counted with those who are cast out of the Kingdom of Heaven. Abraham was 75 years old when God gave him a promise and told him to leave the land of his forefathers. And he left everything (Gen 12:1-4). We can learn so much from him. If we want to follow Jesus, we must also leave everything behind. But his father Terah wanted to go with him. He respected his father and allowed him to go with him. He was promised that although he was 75 years old and had no children, his offspring will be as the stars of heaven (Gen 15:5, 22:17, 26:4, 12:7). Abraham also took Lot along as a nephew and son, since he had no children of his own. Itâ€™s so easy to make a mistake. Lot was a very nice person and it was difficult for Abraham to refuse. They traveled as far as Haran and settled there (Gen 11:31). God stopped speaking to Abraham until his father passed away. When his father had died, then God spoke again to him to continue (Gen 11:32 - 12:1). When God calls you, donâ€™t take anything along except what God says you should take along."

In the Old Testament it ends with the prophet Malachi, after which there was silence for 400 years until John arrived on the scene. God sent John. It is said that he grew up in the wilderness of Judea. There were only five or six small villages in Judea. Weâ€™re not told exactly where he grew up.

But even though things are like that, itâ€™s wonderful that God promises that He will pour out His Spirit on all flesh. And it continues to say that your sons and daughters will prophesy. There are things in the Bible which confuse people. Like the word prophecy is misinterpreted as being like fortune telling, saying who made your child sick, or who cast a spell on you, etc. But thatâ€™s not prophecy; that is occultism.

But then God revealed Himself to Zacharias that they would bear a son and call him John, meaning the \"grace of God\". The birth of John was prophesied many years before. Isaiah who lived about 740 BC prophesied of his birth and so too Malachi, about 540 BC. One could have a whole sermon on Isaiahâ€™s prophesy and another of Malachiâ€™s.

After the construction of that ship, which was at that time the largest ship of its time, one of the builders commented that even God cannot sink it. Many booked for its maiden voyage. It traveled through an area full of icebergs, struck one and sank. Most people on the Titanic drowned.

When Jesusâ€™ strength was failing under the Cross, they looked for a person to carry the cross and they got Simon to carry the Cross. He was, according to some Bible commentators, the father of Alexander and Rufus who became members of the New Testament church. He didnâ€™t want to but he was forced to. He was born in North Africa. Through his carrying the Cross there was blessing upon his children. Itâ€™s a pity when Africans say that Jesus is for the white people. We find so other instances where Jesus identifies with those of Africa, like in this instance, and also when Joseph had to flee to Egypt because Herod wanted to kill the baby Jesus, Africa gave Jesus refuge."

The tax collectors in Jesusâ€™ day collected the tax for the government of the day, the Roman government. Nobody liked them. When they taxed people, they would add to the cost for their own pocket. They were thieves, charging more than the government required. And even today there are such people in the world who require bribes for their work. These tax collectors were therefore despised. And Jesus was sitting with them and ate with them! We must be careful interpreting this lest we think that Jesus loves a person that is corrupt and steals from others. And the sinners with whom Jesus ate would include those who divorce, adulterers, drunkards, blasphemers of God, very evil people."

Who of us havenâ€™t fallen into sin after being a Christian? One thinks of Esau who sought repentance with tears but could not find it. We need to carefully examine this scripture. We should never take God lightly. A person so easily falls into sexual immorality, or some other sin. And then that person confesses the sin but go back to it a few days later. Such a person is poking his finger in Godâ€™s eyes and his future is not good. What is man that you should be fearful of him? Rather fear God Who can put both soul and body in hell (Matt 10:28)."

It is not sufficient to confess your sin and not forsake it. You must confess and forsake it. In the sight of God, sin is a terrible thing. Jesus suffered and died because of our sins. He took them into Himself. Even God turned away from Him and Jesus cried out, â€˜My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?â€™ (Matt 27:46). Sin is terrible, and God Who is absolutely holy has no fellowship with sin. He speaks very harsh words regarding sin, like, â€˜the wages of sin is deathâ€™ (Rom 6:23). If you do not part from your sins, you will die. Peter writes that the one who has confessed his sins and goes back again is like a dog that vomits and eats it again (2Pet 2:22). The Bible says that a person who repents and goes back to his sin, itâ€™s better that he never repented (2Pet 2:20-21; Heb 6:4-6). It is terrible to go back to your sin after confessing it."

And then on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus got up and cried out. It was a very difficult time, because the Jews were planning to kill Him. And Jesus had to go to Galilee, among the gentiles to be safe. He wasnâ€™t with the Jews, the so-called believers, because they were planning to kill Him. Jesus cried out, like an injured buck. What made Him cry out like this? It was because of all the people who claimed to be believers but there were no Living Rivers flowing from their innermost being! One river can change a desert into a garden. Imagine if there are many rivers flowing! Just think of South Africa, if all those rivers were flowing from us, how it will change South Africa."

Bliss and his wife died in a railroad accident. He was 38. His death was a great shock to the Christian world. Moody himself said what a disappointment it was for him. But he also said that from the time he heard that he was to take the memorial service there was just one thing running in his mind, â€œtherefore be ye also readyâ€. When Kjell heard that u. Friedel was so sick in Switzerland he and his friends prayed for him every day that God would touch and heal him and at one point, Kjell said, â€œmaybe one of us will go firstâ€. Moody continued and challenged the audience to be ready before the close of this service. Ask yourself the question, are you ready to meet God?"

The disciple who has theÂ“beautiful attitudesÂ” confronts people with a model of what they should be.

Throughout the Bible Jesus is the God of the living and not of the dead. He has risen from the dead. He is not like the spirits of the dead because He sits at the right hand of God.

But when they came, God left Hezekiah. Previously when the king of Assyria came to besiege Jerusalem, Hezekiah went to the prophet Isaiah, and God sent His angel to kill 185,000 from the Assyrian army, and delivered Jerusalem (2Kings 19). His second test was that of his illness. After he had witnessed Godâ€™s miraculous intervention in saving him from the Assyrians he became ill. God sent the prophet Isaiah to him to say that he had to prepare his house for he will die. But he turned his face to the wall and pleaded with God. God saw his tears and heard his prayer and added 15 years to his life (Isaiah 38; 2Kings 20)."

He also answered that you shall worship the Lord your God and Him alone you shall serve. And also that you shall not tempt the Lord your God (Matt 4).

Even the most dignified and reserved among you will be broken and humbled as little children. The proud and self righteous will not be able to stand in My presence. The doubter and unbeliever will either run for fear or fall on their knees and worship Meâ€”there can be no middle ground. The church will never be the same again. Do you really want revival?"

Edwin Orr wrote: â€˜Its post-war surge of evangelism reached its cress when Robert Pierce [evangelist and UN correspondent], Robert Findley, Gil Dodds and others leaders saw a local revival break forth in the weeks before the outbreak of war in Korea. [which broke out in June 1950]â€™\r\n\r\nBob Finely wrote, â€œWhen Bob Pierce, Gill Dodds and I were invited to Korea we discovered that our Lord had brought us into the midst of revival that might well have been lifted out of the pages of the book of Acts. I saw revival in Korea. I saw more than 25,000 persons profess to accept Christ as Saviour within six weeks. I saw more than four thousand persons daily at 5am prayer meetings. I saw hundreds continue all night in prayer for days on end. I saw crowds up to 75,000 come together to hear the gospel. In such a movement of the Holy Spirit, our part was incidental. These meetings in which we participated were only a small part of the great revival in Korea. All the while there were other great meetings being held by Korean pastors and evangelists. The revival is a demonstration of the awful reality of the person of the Holy Spirit. "
